The purpose of this study was to determine whether spaceflight alters gene expression profiles and induces oxidative damage in the retina. Ten week old adult C57BL/6 male mice were flown aboard the ISS for 35 days and returned to Earth alive. Ground control mice were maintained on Earth under identical environmental conditions. Within 38 (+/&#8722;4) hours after splashdown, mice ocular tissues were collected for analysis. RNA sequencing detected 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in murine spaceflight retinas, which were enriched for genes related to visual perception, the phototransduction pathway, and numerous retina and photoreceptor phenotype categories. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa, characterized by dystrophy of the photoreceptor layer rods and cones. Differentially expressed transcription factors indicated changes in chromatin structure, offering clues to the observed phenotypic changes. Immunofluorescence assays showed degradation of cone photoreceptors and increased retinal oxidative stress. Total retinal, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layer thickness were significantly lower after spaceflight. These results indicate that retinal performance may decrease over extended periods of spaceflight and cause visual impairment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>RNA sequencing</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd><kwd>Experimental models of disease</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><award-id>NNX15AB41G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>da Silveira</surname><given-names>Willian Abraham</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Stanbouly</surname><given-names>Seta</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Roque-Torres</surname><given-names>Gina D.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Zawieja</surname><given-names>David Carl</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Willey</surname><given-names>Jeffrey S.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Delp</surname><given-names>Michael D.</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Hardiman</surname><given-names>Gary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">We are entering an era of renewed interest in space exploration. Although officially the space race ended decades ago, humanity is crossing the threshold into a second space age that includes new global partnerships and private companies. This new infrastructure and organization has brought the concept of long duration space missions, such as permanent moon settlements and manned missions to Mars, from a distant goal to a tangible reality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the space environment is fundamentally different from Earth. Microgravity and ionizing radiation compose a unique set of physiological stressors, the effects of which remain to be fully characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In humans, one of the most apparent physiological responses to the space environment is the redistribution of fluid throughout the body that occurs due to microgravity. This redistribution shifts fluid upward from the lower parts of the body<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. An increased intracranial pressure caused by this fluid shift has been attributed as a major cause of spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. 40% of astronauts have experienced SANS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, including the spaceflight subject of the NASA twins study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The physiological impact of SANS encapsulates multiple components of the eye and includes optic disc edema, globe flattening (GF), choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts (i.e., cotton wool spots)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. While the physiological characteristics of SANS are well documented, the mechanisms that drive SANS are still poorly understood.</p><p id="Par4">To date, despite evidence showing ocular functioning impairment following exposure to the space environment, few studies have investigated molecular mechanisms involved in the spaceflight-associated changes in retinal structure and function. A previous study from our group characterized the effects of a 13-day exposure to the space environment aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135) in mice. This study found that spaceflight conditions induced oxidative damage that resulted in mitochondrial apoptosis in the mouse retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Subsequent work with low-dose proton radiation and a simulated microgravity mice model showed a major role of simulated space radiation in the increase of oxidative stress, with synergistic effects when simulated microgravity&#160;was applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In our current study, mice were exposed to the space environment for 35 days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to determine whether the space environment induces oxidative damage on ocular structure and to characterize gene expression profiles of mouse retina exposed to spaceflight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The space environment causes changes in gene expression related to visual and RNA regulation pathways</title><p id="Par5">The space environment caused a wide array of changes in gene expression, the most prominent were changes in ocular pathways and RNA processing.

Mutations in the gene <italic toggle="yes">Rho</italic>, which creates a protein that composes rod photoreceptors and is essential for vision in low-light conditions, can alter its splice isoforms. These alternate isoforms lead to the construction of abnormal RHO proteins and trigger the pathology of retinitis pigmentosa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

Disruption of these splice isoforms can reduce the density of cone photoreceptors and the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Overall, our results indicate that the space environment might create unique epigenetic events and differential RNA splicing, in addition to the altered gene expression profile reported. Future studies should address which genes are alternatively spliced to understand potential changes in protein structure and find further associations with retinal diseases. Furthermore, mouse models for retinitis pigmentosa are available. Determining which mouse model is most similar to mice exposed to the space environment will help determine the appropriate model to perform Earth-analog experiments. Finding an appropriate Earth-based analog will accelerate the speed of research dedicated to finding a countermeasure for the retinal damage caused by spaceflight.</p><p id="Par18">Several transcription factors were identified as necessary for development and maintenance of the retina and other structures of the eye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Although eight of the DETFs are known for their importance for the retinal development and maintenance in Earth conditions, 21 of the DETFs have no reports in the literature linking them to the eye tissue. From the DETF overrepresentation analysis, transcription factors were identified that are known to influence chromatin architecture. Changes in chromatin architecture indicate that the cause for changes in retinal structure observed during spaceflight is more complex than solely alterations in RNA processing. The overrepresentation analysis showed enrichment of transcriptional regulators for H3K9 demethylation, which is a marker for constitutive heterochromatin. Demethylation of H3K9 can result in the unraveling of this heterochromatin, which can then influence the accessibility of genes and regulatory elements in the genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. This can further drive changes in gene expression and either create abnormal and potentially harmful cellular behavior or act as a compensatory mechanism to mitigate damage the retinal tissue has experienced from spaceflight. The connections between chromatin reorganization as a disease-causing or disease-mitigating mechanism during spaceflight has not yet been explored. Determining the locations of chromatin reorganization could provide insight to these questions. Furthermore, the literature does not report any of the DETFs directly related to retinitis pigmentosa, which could indicate that these genes, although not yet described, could have a role in retinitis pigmentosa or that they are part of spaceflight specific expression network that can be explored as biomarkers and/or drug targets.</p><p id="Par19">Compensatory mechanisms to mitigate cellular damage have been observed in response to oxidative stress. Our immunostaining for marker 4-HNE showed evidence of oxidative stress within the retina. Evidence of a response to this oxidative stress was also observed in the gene expression data. The gene <italic toggle="yes">Bnip3</italic> was differentially expressed, showing upregulation during spaceflight (adjusted p-value: 2.94E-03; log2 fold-change: 0.309). <italic toggle="yes">Bnip3</italic> is known for its role in removing misfolded proteins from the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

From this, we see evidence of a potential compensatory mechanism becoming activated in spaceflight in order to correct and mitigate cellular damage accumulating in retinal tissue. One consideration for long duration space missions are the compensatory mechanisms that are activated in the space environment. For long duration missions, it becomes imperative to evaluate for how long these compensatory mechanisms can be sustained and how to extend or amplify its beneficial effects. Additionally, the nearest Earth-analog disease that we identified, retinitis pigmentosa, has known links to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Although no cure is currently known, supplementation with certain minerals and vitamins, especially vitamin A, has been demonstrated to delay the disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and should be considered a possible countermeasure to spaceflight induced retinal damage.</p><p id="Par20">We also found evidence that the circadian rhythm of the retina was altered in spaceflight. The circadian rhythm regulates behavioral and physiological processes over a 24-hour period, principally controlled by day/night patterns. Disruptions in the circadian rhythm can lead to irregular sleep patterns, mood, and metabolism function, as well as the development of cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

It is important to note that changes in global ocular structure and retinal layer thickness could have clinical and/or pathological significance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The ONL contains the nuclei of the photoreceptor cells and the INL contains the cell bodies of bipolar, horizontal, amacrine, and M&#252;ller cells.

Our results showed degradation in ocular structures by spaceflight, particularly of the retina, RPE, and choroid layers of the eye, as evidenced by their decreased thickness. MicroCT provides an easy and non-destructive technique to image without any modification. Additionally, it shows the entire region of interest digitally, thereby increasing accessibility and reproducibility of the findings.

Future studies should investigate the long-term impact of observed structural changes of the retina and retinal photoreceptors function that may lead to late retinal degeneration. Additional studies are needed to determine which aspects of spaceflight are responsible for photoreceptor damage and oxidative stress. Leading causes include radiation and possible alterations in intracranial pressure (ICP) or intraocular pressure (IOP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> induced by microgravity. It is possible that both space radiation and microgravity work in conjunction with one another to cause a more severe pathological result than either would in isolation. Other factors that may be driving differential gene expression include increased stress an organism experiences due to the physiological pressures of spacecraft takeoff and landing and the psychological pressures of spaceflight. The body size of an organism also impacts the amount of interstitial fluid per gram of body weight, which could impact the magnitude of fluctuating pressures influencing the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Studies using larger organisms could better model the degree of fluctuating pressures experienced by humans during spaceflight.</p><p id="Par24">There are many potential avenues left to explore in order to understand the response of the mammalian retina to spaceflight. In this study we have characterized the physical response of the retina, the degradation of photoreceptors, and the presence of oxidative stress markers. We have also observed several genes with significant differential expression in the spaceflight condition were also differentially expressed in the disease retinitis pigmentosa. Additionally, we suspect the changes that we are observing during spaceflight are influenced by alternative splicing and chromatin reorganization. There remains much work to be done on understanding the mechanism of spaceflight-induced oxidative stress on retinal damage. Additional work will need to be done to separate disease-causing changes in gene expression from compensatory changes.

After fixation, the mice eyes were dehydrated in ethanol. To prevent an abrupt shrinkage of the fixed sample, a graded series of ethanoic solutions were used. Afterwards, the mice eyes were stained in 10% phosphomolybdic acid solution (PMA) for 6 days. Samples were washed in absolute ethanol and then placed each eye in the same rotation in individual 2&#8201;mL plastic containers filled with absolute ethanol for scanning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Micro CT scanning and analysis</title><p id="Par31">Samples were scanned using a high resolution micro-computed tomography system (SkyScan 1272 desktop micro-CT system, Bruker, Kontich, Belgium), with an accelerating source voltage of 50&#8201;keV, a source current of 80&#8201;mA with an integration time of 90&#8201;min. During the scanning process, the samples were rotated at 180 degrees, with an imaging voxel size of 4.5&#8201;um, frame averaging of 4, rotation step of 0.4 and no filter. These images were saved for the reconstruction of the 3D object. The thickness of the retina and surrounding tissues were measured on MicroCT images by descriptive analysis. Measurements of the lens, retina, RPE layer, choroid and sclera were performed in the middle slice of the sagittal view of each sample using the optical nerve as reference. Three measurements were recorded of each structure to finally obtain an average.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>RNA/DNA extraction</title><p id="Par32">Retina tissues (n&#8201;=&#8201;8/group) were homogenized with Precellys CKM beads (Hilden, Germany) in 600&#8201;&#181;l of RLT plus buffer. Total RNA and DNA were extracted using the QIAGEN AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit according to the manufacturer&#8217;s protocol. After isolation, RNA and DNA were frozen and kept at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C until further use. Isolated RNA samples were quantified and purity checked by NanoDrop spectrophotometry (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Chino, CA). DNA and RNA were further quantified using the Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity Kit and RNA Broad Range Kit, respectively (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). RNA quality was evaluated using the Agilent 2200 TapeStation and RNA ScreenTape with 1ul of randomly selected RNA denatured at 72&#8201;&#176;C for three minutes per manufacturer&#8217;s instructions (Santa Clara, CA).

First and second strands of cDNA were synthesized from total RNA (100&#8201;ng) spiked with 1&#8201;&#181;l of 1:500 diluted ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mix 2 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) at the appropriate ratio. Following primer annealing and cDNA synthesis, the products were sheared using Covaris S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA). 130&#8201;&#181;l of each sample was sheared according to manufacturer&#8217;s instructions. The parameters were set as follows: 10% duty factor, peak power 175 and 200 cycles per burst at 4&#8201;&#176;C for 200&#8201;seconds to obtain fragment sizes between 150&#8211;200&#8201;bp. This was followed by end-repair, adaptor index ligation and strand selection. Strand selection was performed by using custom InDA-C primer mixture SS5 Version5 for mice with cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomal RNA depletion. Finally, libraries were amplified using 17 cycles (Mastercycler<sup>&#174;</sup> pro, Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), and purified with RNAClean XP Agencourt beads.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Library quantification and quality control (QC) test</title><p id="Par34">The final amplified libraries were purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) and quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Kit on Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA).

Single-indexed and single-end reads with 75 nucleotides length (1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;75&#8201;bp) were generated. Fastq files generated from the sequence run were demultiplexed (Loma Linda University Center for Genomics), quality checked (quality score &gt;38), trimmed from adapters with Trimmomatic (version 0.01) and mapped against mouse reference genome (NCBI_build_37.2) with TOPHAT2 (version 2).
