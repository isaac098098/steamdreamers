However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Our results from the mature microvessel model support this notion, since mature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is too rapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does not rule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24&#8201;h after GCR irradiation and 48&#8201;h after antagomir treatment, protection of microvessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressed control not treated with antagomirs.</p><p id="Par45">Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarly effective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosis and p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids, and cholesterol metabolism (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higher doses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signaling. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is a possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on suppressing DNA repair indicates a much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiation exposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would include genes of general inflammatory and immune pathways. There are 5 genes that are affected in common with all 3 antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genes affected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out.

The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected by radiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescue harmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOS pathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress, showed a rescue-like effect (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insufficient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Electron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in this process and show downregulation in the presence of radiation.

Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population (fibroblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human).</p><p id="Par49">The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied.

So to perfectly recreate the space radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive during long-duration spaceflights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used for irradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation for validation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasure developments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astronaut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during spaceflight are key to meaningful interpretation of biological results applicable to space flight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery might account for any deviations between the results we are observing.</p><p id="Par51">The present microvascularized model is a simplified system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence of the very important pericytes.

Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-h post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO<sub>2</sub> overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (0.5&#8201;M) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2000&#8201;&#215;&#8201;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 15&#8201;min.

All organs were flash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at &#8722;80&#8201;&#176;C.

The following doses of irradiation were administered; GCR (0.5&#8201;Gy) and Sham control (0&#8201;Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during a Mars mission, though it is modeled as a single exposure over 25&#8201;min instead of the actual chronic exposures over 1.5 years. A 60&#8201;&#215;&#8201;60 beam was utilized at the NSRL for irradiation. Sham controls were treated similarly to GCR irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simulation, i.e. 25&#8201;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>miRNA extraction from murine tissues</title><p id="Par76">MiRNA extractions from plasma and all tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy serum/plasma kit (Cat# 217184).
