This study evaluates the mechanism for increased virulence of the opportunistic gram-negative bacterium, <italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens,</italic> in simulated microgravity. Low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is used in ground-based studies to simulate the effects of microgravity as experienced in spaceflight. Our previous findings showed that there was a significant increase in mortality rates of the <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> host when infected with either spaceflight or LSMMG treated <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic>. Here, we report that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> and that the increased host lethality induced by LSMMG bacteria grown in rich media can be recapitulated in minimal media by adding only aspartate and glutamine, the substrates of asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone is not sufficient to contribute to maximal host lethality, since the addition of aspartate to minimal media caused an LSMMG-specific increase in bacterial growth rate that is comparable to that induced by the combination of aspartate and glutamine, but this increase in growth does not cause an equivalent rate of host mortality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine cause both an increase in host mortality and an overexpression of asparagine pathway genes in a LSMMG-dependent manner. We also report that L-asparaginase-mediated breakdown of asparagine is an effective countermeasure for the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This investigation underscores the importance of the asparagine utilization pathway by helping uncover molecular mechanisms that underlie increased mortality rates of a model host infected with microgravity-treated <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> and provides a potential mitigation strategy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="teaser" id="abs0015"><p>Low shear modeled microgravity; <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>; <italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens</italic>; Asparagine; Virulence.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Low shear modeled microgravity</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens</italic></kwd><kwd>Asparagine</kwd><kwd>Virulence</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Human pathogens occupy a wide variety of ecological niches, including those in the harsh conditions imposed by spaceflight. Understanding the effects that spaceflight may have on the adaptation and fitness of human pathogens is necessary to predict potential causes of health problems during future missions, where the availability of treatment and prevention options is limited. This is even more important in the context of opportunistic bacterial pathogens, which typically produce benign infections, until they are challenged by certain environmental conditions or when host immune impairments occur, which can then equip them with the ability to cause serious health concerns [<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. One such environmental condition is spaceflight, which has been demonstrated to convert opportunistic pathogens to primary pathogens, enabling them to take advantage of a compromised immune system that may occur to astronauts during spaceflight [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In line with this, there is mounting evidence that primary bacterial pathogens often undergo a diversity of significant phenotypic shifts during spaceflight, including increased antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], increased virulence [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and morphological changes associated with pathogenicity [<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Despite mounting research in these primary pathogens, much less is known about phenotypic shifts that occur to opportunistic pathogens when exposed to microgravity. Specifically, there is little known about how pathogens may be utilizing nutrients differently in the microgravity environment of space compared to ground microbes, and potentially how these mechanistic changes might be influencing the host immune response during infection.</p><p id="p0015">Due to increased nosocomial reports, the human opportunistic bacteria, <italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens,</italic> has emerged as a model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> is a ubiquitous pathogen that occupies a wide variety of habitats and hosts. It can adapt quickly to antibiotics independently and simultaneously, which is likely due to the loss of conserved genetic elements and large genomic diversity among strains [<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> was found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station [<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for spaceflight-induced changes that may pose a threat to immunocompromised astronauts that are more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens and especially considering the complications with antibiotic resistance [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p id="p0020">Research in our laboratory has demonstrated that there is a significant shift in virulence with <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> (Db11) after spaceflight. When cultured aboard the International Space Station, <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> Db11 killed healthy ground-reared <italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic> hosts significantly faster than an identical control of the bacteria that was cultured on the ground [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the specific mechanisms of increased Db11 virulence and reduced <italic toggle="yes">D.&#160;melanogaster</italic> survival are currently unknown. In line with this, increased virulence is observed with various space and low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG)-isolated bacteria, including studies with <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus aureus</italic> [<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], which pose a threat to astronaut health during spaceflight. Our prior research has shown that <italic toggle="yes">Serratia marcescens</italic> also shows a significant increase in host lethality of <italic toggle="yes">D.&#160;melanogaster</italic> after growth in simulated microgravity (LSMMG) conditions [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0025">Since spaceflight studies are costly and can be difficult to perform due to constraints on experimental design and the availability of spaceflight opportunities, many researchers perform ground-based studies using devices such as the rotating wall vessel (RWV) to simulate microgravity [<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles, thereby creating a low fluid shear environment that simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated such that the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g) without continuous suspension while acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the vessel itself. Although this method is not an exact recreation of the spaceflight environment, the effects of the LSMMG environment have been demonstrated to recapitulate findings from spaceflight studies [<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p id="p0030"><italic toggle="yes">Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, as used in this study, has proven to be a useful host model for spaceflight and ground-based studies in the past.

A screen of several genes related to known <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> virulence factors did not reveal any differences of expression in LSMMG compared to RWV-Control. Further testing revealed a LSMMG-dependent overexpression of the gene asparagine synthetase B (<italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic>), which is implicated in virulence and resistance to drugs in other pathogenic bacteria [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This gene is involved with amino acid metabolism and has been linked to both pathogen growth and virulence [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Amino acids like asparagine are thought to be important to the competition between hosts and pathogens in determining the outcome of an infection [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Since our previous study indicated that the LSMMG-reared <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> killed the host faster after infection [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] than control <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> cultures, we wanted to explore whether the asparagine pathway might be linked to the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG treatment.</p><p id="p0040">Here, we show that LSMMG treatment causes a change in the expression of key asparagine pathway related genes in <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> with a concomitant increase in host mortality. Further, we find that these changes in key asparagine pathway genes and increased host mortality can be recapitulated in an LSMMG-specific manner by the addition of aspartate and glutamine (the substrates of asparagine synthesis) to minimal media. We also show that the addition of L-asparaginase, which catabolizes asparagine, can mitigate the LSMMG-induced increase in host virulence. Thus, this study allows us to understand the phenotypic shifts occurring in microbes exposed to altered gravity, and more specifically, how amino acid metabolism may affect the mortality rate of the host. In addition, these results will allow us to explore the asparagine pathway further and develop countermeasures that target amino acid biosynthesis in opportunistic pathogens such as <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens, as</italic> an essential consideration to maintain host health during spaceflight.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>The asparagine pathway and extracellular asparagine and glutamine concentrations are affected by simulated microgravity treatment of <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic></title><p id="p0045">Our previous findings have indicated that <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> exposed to LSMMG for 24 h grow at a faster rate inside the host after infection and caused increased host lethality in <italic toggle="yes">D.melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. First, we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control bacteria (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#160;3</xref>). We, therefore, looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms and found that genes related to asparagine metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG. More specifically, we found that there was a significant upregulation in <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> (asparagine synthetase B), which is a gene that regulates the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>A,B). Therefore, we evaluated the expression of genes that are important for asparagine and glutamine metabolism. Gene expression analyses showed that the expression level of the gene <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> (asparagine synthetase B) was 39.17 fold higher in LSMMG-treated cells relative to the RWV-control (P &lt; 0.0001), as well as a 10.5 fold increase in expression of L-asparaginase (<italic toggle="yes">L-ap</italic>, P = 0.054), but there was no significant difference in expression for the other genes tested, although several genes showed a positive trend for expression levels: <italic toggle="yes">L-ap1</italic> (L-asparaginase 1), <italic toggle="yes">L-ap2</italic> (L-asparaginase 2), <italic toggle="yes">iaaA</italic> (isoaspartyl peptidase/L-asparaginase), or <italic toggle="yes">astL</italic> (asparagine tRNA ligase) (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>D). <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> is a gene that catalyzes the conversion of aspartate to asparagine using ATP and glutamine, and is known to be linked to virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The L-asparaginase subunits assist with asparagine catabolism and nitrogen homeostasis [<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], therefore, an overexpression of these genes suggests that there is an increase in asparagine catabolism as part of the overall homeostatic regulation of the asparagine pathway.<fig id="fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Figure&#160;1</label><caption><p>The asparagine pathway and increased uptake of extracellular asparagine and glutamine from nutrient-rich LB media under simulated microgravity.

To confirm this, we quantified the rates at which <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> utilized extracellular glutamine and asparagine in the nutrient-rich LB media, in order to see whether the consumption rates of these amino acids matched the increased growth of the bacteria in LSMMG.

importance of nutrient utilization during bacterial growth as a factor for increased host mortality after pathogen growth in LSMMG. Host mortality is a direct measure of pathogen virulence, and therefore an increased rate of host death is one indication of increased virulence of a pathogen [<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While there are studies showing an increase in virulence of pathogens after exposure to spaceflight and simulated microgravity, the specific mechanisms that underlie these changes are largely unknown. In our previous study [<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], we found that <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> in spaceflight and in LSMMG show an increase in virulence via increased rate of host mortality, and that the <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> growth of the pathogen after infection of the host is higher from both spaceflight and LSMMG treated bacteria. While <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> growth is only an indirect proxy for virulence, faster pathogen growth immediately following infection is often linked to the ability of the pathogen to overcome host immunity and sustain infection [<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore it was necessary for us to examine in more detail the specific potential mechanisms for increased virulence of <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> in LSMMG.</p><p id="p0090">First we looked at several genes involved in flagella formation, membrane-bound proteins, and known virulence genes, and did not see significant upregulation in LSMMG compared to the control (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#160;3</xref>). We therefore looked at other genes linked to bacterial growth mechanisms, and found that genes related to amino acid metabolism were upregulated in LSMMG (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>B). We found that several genes within the asparagine synthesis pathway were overexpressed in LSMMG, but specifically saw the largest overexpression, an almost 40-fold increase, in the asparagine synthetase B (<italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> gene). Asparagine synthetase B is an enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of asparagine using aspartate, and glutamine as a nitrogen source [<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. The deletion of the <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> gene leads to a slow-growth phenotype in the pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and in most pathogens (including <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic>) is the main gene involved in asparagine biosynthesis [<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. This gene has not been implicated previously in <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> virulence, but has been shown to mediate virulence and resistance to drugs in other bacterial pathogens [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. While this gene and others in amino acid uptake pathways are important for growth and division of the cell, they are also important mediators of host-pathogen interactions [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While the host utilizes amino acid metabolism to support defense responses against a pathogen, conversely, the pathogen can modulate amino acid metabolism for its own advantage [<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, amino acid utilization and assimilation mechanisms can be important mediators of infection at the host-pathogen interface, and asparagine metabolism has been linked to virulence and resistance of some pathogens to antibiotics [<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].<table-wrap position="float" id="tbl3" orientation="portrait"><label>Table&#160;3</label><caption><p>Expression values of candidate genes in <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> for growth, motility, and virulence as measured by qPCR.

We show that <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> grown in LSMMG consume key amino acids glutamine and asparagine at a faster rate than the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>C, D), suggesting that the LSMMG might be priming these pathogens to compete with responding host immune cells for extracellular amino acids necessary for proliferation. In fact, this is the method by which some pathogens are successful colonizers of their hosts. The virulence of pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Francisella tularensis</italic> is dependent on the pathogen's ability to replicate inside the host and escape from macrophages [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Asparagine acquisition is critical in this pathogen's success in replicating inside the host cell, where they use the host as a substrate for asparagine and aspartate necessary to replicate [<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> has been shown to have the ability to survive and proliferate inside non-phagocytic host cells, suggesting that there may be a similar mechanism of host-pathogen competition for amino acids [<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. We see in our study that growth in LSMMG increases the expression of <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>B), implying an increased consumption of aspartate and glutamine to synthesize asparagine more efficiently, that may allow these pathogens to out-compete host immune cells for amino acids during infection. The presence of both aspartate and glutamine causes a significant overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic>, even when they are the only amino acids present in minimal media (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>E). This suggests that these two amino acid substrates, which are both required for asparagine synthesis, are important for LSMMG-induced overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic>. Therefore, we believe that the LSMMG-induced increase in pathogen virulence may be mediated by the ability of <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> to utilize asparagine more efficiently within the host after infection, although further studies are needed to evaluate how <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> reared in LSMMG are specifically interacting with the host's immune cells.</p><p id="p0100">We also found evidence that there is an overexpression of some L-asparaginase subunits, including L-asparaginase (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>E and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>B) when <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> is overexpressed in the presence of its substrates, aspartate and glutamine. The homeostatic maintenance of the asparagine pathway consists of the anabolic and catabolic processes catalyzed by asnB and L-ap respectively which could result in the upregulation of both enzymes with increased asparagine metabolism. In <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella typhimurium</italic> infections, it has been shown that L-asparaginase suppresses T-cell responses by suppressing T-cell blastogenesis, proliferation, and cytokine production in the host, and that this effect could be attenuated by treatment with L-asparagine [<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. This highlights the fact that asparagine can be a key amino acid both for mammalian immune responses to bacterial pathogens, and is also important for bacterial growth and virulence properties. In this study, we provide evidence that the asparagine pathway is a critical determinant of the LSMMG-dependent increase in host mortality induced by <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic>.</p><p id="p0105">While aspartate alone can increase <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> growth of <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> in an LSMMG-specific manner (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>D), the combination of both aspartate and glutamine (substrates for asparagine synthesis) are required to cause the maximal increase in host lethality during the infection of <italic toggle="yes">D.melanogaster</italic> with LSMMG treated bacteria (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>A). Similarly, the presence of both aspartate and glutamine are required to elicit the full induction of <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> gene expression which is not seen with aspartate or glutamine addition alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>E). Interestingly, these results indicate that increased division rate of the pathogen during the growth phase alone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>) is not sufficient to recapitulate the full extent of host mortality observed after infection with microgravity-treated <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>). Therefore, the microgravity dependent increase in host mortality induced by <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic>, appears to be linked specifically with asparagine pathway function under LSMMG conditions, and cannot be fully accounted for simply by increasing bacterial growth rate with the addition of amino acid substrates. To further characterize the effect of the asparagine pathway, the direct suppression of the expression of <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> through controlled genetic mechanisms was not within the scope of this study. However, as mentioned above, we demonstrated that the attenuation of the asparagine pathway, via the absence of relevant amino acids from the growth media, suppresses the overexpression of <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> in LSMMG (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>E) and correlates with increased host survival (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>B,C). Additional studies that target <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> gene with a knockdown will be conducted in future.</p><p id="p0110">When we co-infect flies with both LSMMG-reared <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> and exogenously-added purified L-asparaginase, we see a therapeutic effect, and the flies die at a significantly slower rate than the LSMMG-reared bacteria injected alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>C). This is in line with our hypothesis that growth in LSMMG is priming <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> with the ability to compete effectively with the host for asparagine utilization. The addition of L-asparaginase would break down extracellular asparagine, thereby diminishing the ability of the bacteria to out-compete the host's ability to utilize asparagine for its cellular processes. Consistent with this, L-asparaginase added to the growth medium causes suppression of <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> growth, but only in LSMMG and not in the RWV-Control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>B). These results suggest that additional exogenous L-asparaginase has a detrimental effect on the pathogen itself and causes it to become less virulent in LSMMG, perhaps by reducing the amount of available asparagine that otherwise would have enhanced the LSMMG-treated microbe's ability to utilize this amino acid in the host's body. In growth media without the presence of exogenous L-asparaginase, the L-asparagine in the growth media is consumed at a significantly faster rate in LSMMG than in the RWV-Control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>C), and a similar effect is seen with the consumption of glutamine (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>D). In some pathogens, mutants lacking the ability to synthesize glutamine or to acquire glutamine from the host, show attenuated virulence, since this is an important source of nitrogen assimilation during colonization of the pathogen in the host [<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. These studies further support the idea that amino acids that are critical for several cellular processes, including protein synthesis, can also be important for pathogen virulence.</p><p id="p0115">To summarize the results of our study, we report that genes related to asparagine biosynthesis were overexpressed after exposing <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> to LSMMG, and that the consumption rates of extracellular asparagine and glutamine in rich media were higher in LSMMG than in the control (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;1</xref>). In nutrient-limited media, these gene expression and virulence patterns can be recapitulated by supplying only the precursors for asparagine biosynthesis: glutamine and aspartate (Figures&#160;<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). The addition of aspartate causes a LSMMG-specific increase in growth of <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> but not a concomitant increase in <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> gene expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>D,E). Therefore, LSMMG-specific increase in expression of the <italic toggle="yes">asnB</italic> gene is only seen in media that contains both aspartate and glutamine, the precursors for asparagine synthesis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;3</xref>E). Consistent with this, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine in the media during growth is also necessary for the greatest increase in host mortality in LSMMG compared to the control (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;4</xref>A). Furthermore, the coinjection of exogenous asparaginase during the infection of fly hosts with LSMMG-reared <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens,</italic> results in a therapeutic effect and the flies die more slowly than with injections of the LSMMG-treated bacteria alone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure&#160;2</xref>C).</p><p id="p0120">The results of this study provide compelling evidence for the involvement of the asparagine pathway in increasing <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens'</italic> effectiveness to kill its host in a microgravity-specific manner. This study provides a novel mechanism by which microgravity might be affecting <italic toggle="yes">S.&#160;marcescens</italic> virulence via modified nutrient utilization capabilities. Importantly, we found that L-asparaginase could be used as a potential therapeutic agent during infections with bacteria in LSMMG. An interesting sequelae to this study would be to test the L-asparaginase as a countermeasure where both the host and the pathogen are exposed to microgravity during spaceflight. This study also furthers our need for understanding how LSMMG may be a unique stressor on bacterial pathogens, and emphasizes the importance of the use of ground-based models in informing spaceflight research.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="p0125">While this work provides evidence that LSMMG is priming the pathogen to out-compete the host immune system by the efficient utilization of amino acids such as asparagine, we have not yet evaluated the metabolomics of the host-pathogen interface after infection.

Liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of 0.100 in LB media and loaded into a sterile 10 mL rotating wall vessel (Synthecon). The RWV simulates microgravity by rotating at a speed and orientation which keeps cells suspended in liquid without bubbles and simulates the weightlessness that cells experience during spaceflight [<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and this is referred to as the LSMMG treatment. When using the RWV to induce LSMMG, the vessel is rotated with an axis of rotation that is perpendicular to the orientation of the gravity vector and the rotation offsets the sedimental effects of gravity and keeps the cells in continuous suspension (LSMMG). In contrast, in the control orientation (RWV-Control), the axis of rotation is parallel to the gravity vector and does not offset the sedimentation induced by Earth's gravitational force. Thus, in the RWV-Control, the cells can settle at the bottom of the container and experience Earth gravity (1g), thereby acting as a control for any potential biological effects of the container vessel itself [<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
