Unfortunately, few of these experiments have involved monocot plants, which constitute most of the crops used on Earth as sources of food, feed, and fiber. To better understand the ability of monocot plants to adapt to spaceflight, we germinated and grew <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> seedlings of the Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8 accessions in a customized growth unit on the International Space Station, along with 1-g ground controls. At the end of a 4-day growth period, seedling organ&#8217;s growth and morphologies were quantified, and root and shoot transcriptomic profiles were investigated using RNA-seq. The roots of all three accessions grew more slowly and displayed longer root hairs under microgravity conditions relative to ground control. On the other hand, the shoots of Bd21-3 and Gaz-8 grew at similar rates between conditions, whereas those of Bd21 grew more slowly under microgravity. The three Brachypodium accessions displayed dramatically different transcriptomic responses to microgravity relative to ground controls, with the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) found in Gaz8 (4527), followed by Bd21 (1353) and Bd21-3 (570). Only 47 and six DEGs were shared between accessions for shoots and roots, respectively, including DEGs encoding wall-associated proteins and photosynthesis-related DEGs. Furthermore, DEGs associated with the &#8220;Oxidative Stress Response&#8221; GO group were up-regulated in the shoots and down-regulated in the roots of Bd21 and Gaz8, indicating that Brachypodium roots and shoots deploy distinct biological strategies to adapt to the microgravity environment. A comparative analysis of the Brachypodium oxidative-stress response DEGs with the Arabidopsis ROS wheel suggests a connection between retrograde signaling, light response, and decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes in microgravity-exposed shoots. In Gaz8, DEGs were also found to preferentially associate with the &#8220;Plant Hormonal Signaling&#8221; and &#8220;MAP Kinase Signaling&#8221; KEGG pathways. Overall, these data indicate that <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> seedlings exposed to the microgravity environment of ISS display accession- and organ-specific responses that involve oxidative stress response, wall remodeling, photosynthesis inhibition, expression regulation, ribosome biogenesis, and post-translational modifications. The general characteristics of these responses are similar to those displayed by microgravity-exposed <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings. However, organ- and accession-specific components of the response dramatically differ both within and between species. These results suggest a need to directly evaluate candidate-crop responses to microgravity to better understand their specific adaptability to this novel environment and develop cultivation strategies allowing them to strive during spaceflight.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic></kwd><kwd>Bd21</kwd><kwd>Bd21-3</kwd><kwd>Gaz8</kwd><kwd>microgravity</kwd><kwd>International Space Station</kwd><kwd>APEX Growth Unit</kwd><kwd>VEGGIE</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>seedling growth</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>NASA</funding-source><award-id>NNX14AT23G</award-id><award-id>80NSSC19K1483</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>National Science Foundation</funding-source><award-id>1951182-IOS</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This research was funded by the NASA Space Biology Program (grant number NNX14AT23G and 80NSSC19K1483) and the National Science Foundation (grant number 1951182-IOS).</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-life-13-00626"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>On Earth, plants are exposed to a unidirectional 1-g force that guides the growth of their organs (gravitropism). Furthermore, the weight imposed by gravity on each organ results in a mechanical load that must be counteracted by thick, sturdy cell walls and specialized morphologies. Millions of years of evolution on Earth have assured the effectiveness of these gravitropic, gravi-resistance, and gravimorphogenesis processes, allowing plants to grow and develop properly, forming morphologies that effectively permit completion of their life cycle [<xref rid="B1-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Spaceflight, on the other hand, imposes very different constraints on the plants, which they never encountered during their evolution on Earth.</p><p>During spaceflight, the directional cue provided by gravity is insufficient to modulate gravitropism, gravi-resistance, and other directional cues within the environment. Therefore other tropisms have to take over and guide plant organ growth, including light, gradients in water, oxygen, temperature, ions, and chemicals [<xref rid="B2-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Similarly, the weightlessness associated with microgravity exposure implies a lack of weight-bearing on plant organs, leading to different mechanical constraints on their growth behaviors [<xref rid="B1-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Other critical alterations of the physical environment encountered by plants during spaceflight include a lack of gravity-induced convection resulting in diminished gas exchange at the surface of the plant, altered photosynthesis, respiration, hypoxia, and thermoregulation [<xref rid="B1-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, exposure to elevated cosmic radiation can substantially impact the morphology, biology, and genetic makeup of plants during spaceflight [<xref rid="B9-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the environmental cues that plants experience during spaceflight trigger a range of biological stress responses that lead to phenotypes collectively named &#8220;space syndrome&#8221;. These include shorter organs, thinner leaves, roots tending to grow away from the light source (negative phototropism) while also skewing in some cases, root hairs of altered size, modified organelle size and shape, altered metabolism, and accumulation of starch, to cite only a few [<xref rid="B10-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Researchers have heavily relied on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling approaches to reveal key molecular pathways that are responsive to the spaceflight environment relative to ground controls. Experiments using mostly <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings or plant tissue cultures as experimental materials have revealed potential contributions of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, light and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, cell wall remodeling, and defense responses in plant adaptation to the spaceflight environment [<xref rid="B6-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Some of these expression changes were accompanied by alterations in the pattern of CNG and CNN DNA methylation in the proximity of the corresponding genes, suggesting some epigenetic contribution to the process [<xref rid="B24-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interestingly, a short root-hair phenotype displayed by Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the BRIC hardware onboard the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) was accompanied by decreased expression of genes associated with oxidative stress (such as peroxidases) and cell wall remodeling, and reverse genetics demonstrated a contribution of some of these genes in modulation of root hair growth [<xref rid="B14-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The profiling investigations described above have revealed a large variability in expression responses between experiments due in part to differences in hardware used to grow the plants, growth conditions, and plant genotypes (reviewed in [<xref rid="B25-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). The latter parameter (plant genotype) is particularly interesting to consider. Indeed, the geographical origin of a specific plant accession plays a key role in defining the type of responses the plant will develop under specific environmental conditions, reflecting an important role for selective forces in dictating the evolution of adaptive traits. Consequently, for any plant species, individual ecotypes carry specific sets of alleles that allowed the plants to not only survive and adapt to the conditions of their native environment, but also result in distinct abilities to cope with new environments to which they might subsequently become exposed. Therefore, it is not surprising that experiments attempting to evaluate Arabidopsis&#8217;s ability to adapt to the microgravity environment have revealed dramatic accession-specific differences in their ability to grow, develop, and respond molecularly to this novel environment.</p><p>In fact, most experiments aimed at investigating Arabidopsis transcriptional responses to spaceflight have been carried out using the Col ecotype at the seedling stage [<xref rid="B10-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B26-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or as cell cultures [<xref rid="B18-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Additionally, transcriptomic responses to spaceflight of Ler-0 and Ws ecotypes have been investigated in multiple space environments such as in Space Shuttles [<xref rid="B8-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and the International Space Station (ISS) [<xref rid="B17-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B22-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], using a variety of hardware such as the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS: [<xref rid="B10-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B15-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]) or the CARA experiment [<xref rid="B16-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], respectively. More recently, a landmark paper described a more thorough comparative transcriptomic analysis of four Arabidopsis ecotypes (Col-0, Ws-2, Ler-0, and Cvi-0) exposed to either microgravity conditions or 1-g [<xref rid="B6-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Altogether, these experiments demonstrated that different accessions display both common and accession-specific responses to the microgravity environment relative to ground controls. Shared transcriptomic responses included the activation of expression of molecular chaperones that may protect the cells against oxidative damage imposed by the hypoxic conditions that typically develop around plant organs in the absence of convective buoyancy under microgravity [<xref rid="B6-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>While <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> serves as an outstanding genetic model for investigations of dicot plant responses to the microgravity environment encountered during spaceflight, most major agriculture crops grown on Earth for food, feed, and fiber are monocots, which diverged from the dicots ~150 million years ago [<xref rid="B27-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Unfortunately, comparatively fewer experiments have been carried out to investigate the effects of spaceflight on monocot plant growth, morphology, and expression profiles. The wheat PESTO experiment investigated the growth of semi-dwarf wheat plants (<italic toggle="yes">Triticum aestivum</italic> L. cv. USU Apo) onboard the ISS relative to 1-g ground controls, demonstrating the existence of morphological differences between these two groups, including thinner leaves with ovoid chloroplasts and greater packaging density for microgravity-exposed plants relative to ground controls [<xref rid="B13-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similar phenotypes were also displayed by microgravity-exposed <italic toggle="yes">Zea mays</italic> plants [<xref rid="B28-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (<italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic> L. cv. Koshihikari) grown for 68.5&#8211;136 h in the Space Shuttle STS-95 mission displayed longer roots than ground control, a phenotype associated with some thinning of the cell wall along with higher elasticity modulus and viscosity coefficient in space relative to ground controls [<xref rid="B29-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Shagimardanova and colleagues analyzed the effects of microgravity on the transcriptome of barley (<italic toggle="yes">Hordeum vulgare</italic>) plants growing in the Lada root module onboard the ISS [<xref rid="B30-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They observed substantial transcriptomic differences between spaceflight and ground-control seedlings, including genes preferentially associated with stress response, pathogenesis, and antioxidant pathways [<xref rid="B30-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. On the other hand, rice seedlings (<italic toggle="yes">Oryza sativa</italic> L.) germinated and grown in a <italic toggle="yes">Science in Microgravity Box</italic> (SIMBOX) biological incubator on board the Shenzhou-8 spacecraft displayed dramatically altered photosynthesis characteristics with decreased photosystem 1 (PS1) efficiency relative to ground controls. This phenotype was associated with decreased abundance of proteins associated with the PS1, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (NDH), and cytochrome b6f (Cytb6f) complexes. Hence, spaceflight may lead to declines in PSI activity in rice, either as a direct consequence of microgravity, or caused by side effects of spaceflight associated with inefficient airflow, high CO<sub>2</sub> and ethylene levels, radiation, and/or other experimental parameters [<xref rid="B31-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we present the results of an experiment named APEX-06 (Advanced Plant Experiment-06) aimed at investigating the effect of spaceflight on the growth, morphology, and transcriptome profiles of <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic>, a genetic model for monocots closely related to cereal crops such as oat, wheat, barley, and rice [<xref rid="B32-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. We show that Brachypodium seedlings grown on the surface of foam substrates within modified Magenta-Box containers display accession-specific alterations in seedling organ growth onboard the ISS relative to ground controls. Surprisingly, exposure of Brachypodium to spaceflight conditions also triggered increased root-hair growth under our cultivation conditions, a phenotype that correlated with altered expression of key genes associated with ROS signaling and root-hair growth in one of the tested accessions. We also report dramatic differences in organ-specific transcriptomic responses to the spaceflight environment between Brachypodium accessions and discuss these observations within the context of monocot plant adaptation to spaceflight. Because a 1&#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> centrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber utilized in these experiments, the growth and transcriptomic responses to spaceflight observed in this project may be the consequence of exposure to microgravity, radiation, or other spaceflight-associated parameters such as inefficient airflow and gas exchange, high ethylene levels, and/or other parameters.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-life-13-00626"><title>2.

A Novel APEX Growth Unit Allows Transportation of Pre-Planted Dry Brachypodium distachyon Seeds to ISS and Subsequent Activation of Germination</title><p>Experiments aimed at investigating the effects of microgravity environments on plant growth, development, and gene expression relative to ground controls should be conducted such that germination and growth occur under microgravity for the treated plants, avoiding any post-germination exposure to the 1-g conditions of Earth and/or hypergravity and vibration conditions typically experienced during takeoff and flight back to Earth.

Plants growing on the surface of this foam block are contained within the Magenta jar, which maintains sterile conditions throughout the experiment. Several layers of medical gauze surrounding the nutrient-filled foam block assure better foam-to-root nutrient distribution during plant growth.

Seedlings grown under microgravity showed more variation in shoot and root growth direction than those grown on the ground (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A), as expected considering the absence of gravi-response under microgravity. However, seedling organs were not randomly oriented. Shoots generally grew toward the light canopy whereas roots tended to grow away from it (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>A). These directional growth trends may be partly due to the original orientation of the seeds embedded into the foam. However, phototropism may also offer directional guidance under microgravity.</p><p>Morphologically, microgravity-exposed seedling roots were 16% to 18% shorter than ground controls for all three accessions tested at the end of the growth period (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>B).

Indeed, the roots of microgravity-grown Brachypodium seedlings of all accessions were hairier than those grown on earth, at least for areas of the roots in direct contact with the feeding-block surface (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D). Unfortunately, we could not determine if this hairy-root phenotype was associated with increased root-hair density under microgravity.

In all cases, root hairs were significantly longer on microgravity-exposed seedlings than ground controls (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>D,E).

Candidate genes identified by both packages as displaying significant differences in expression between microgravity and ground control conditions are discussed below.</p><p>The three Brachypodium accessions tested in APEX-06 showed distinguishable expression responses to the microgravity environment of ISS.

In fact, a vast majority of DEGs were differentially expressed in only shoots or roots (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>C). This observation held true for all accessions tested in this study.</p><p>When comparing accessions, only 46 and four DEGs were found to be shared by all three accessions in shoots and roots, respectively. We define these genes as common DEGs (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S5</xref>). The common DEGs share several interesting features. First, most of these common DEGs display expression changes in the same direction (up or down) under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls in all three accessions (with only one exception in the shoot samples). This observation may suggest that the common DEGs represent a significant component of plant responses to the microgravity conditions on ISS. Second, we performed a GO enrichment analysis of these common DEGs, using their Arabidopsis orthologues as queries. While the list of common root DEGs was too small to warrant such an analysis, we noticed an enrichment of the list of down-regulated common shoot DEGs for genes associated with the Photosynthesis (GO:0015979; FDR = 8.6 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup>), Photosynthesis/Light Reaction (GO:0019684; FDR = 7.4 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;7</sup>), and Generation of Precursor Metabolites and Energy (GO:0006091; FDR = 6.3 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;5</sup>) GO groups. All these GO groups belong to the Photosynthesis-Related hierarchy (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S5</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous studies in Arabidopsis [<xref rid="B50-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and rice [<xref rid="B31-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and also with our observation discussed in the following section that photosynthesis-related Gene Ontologies (GOs) are enriched in the general lists of down-regulated shoot DEGs in all three accessions (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Figure S4</xref>).

However, the DEGs belonging to this GO group were distinct between shoot and root tissues (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S6</xref>). In the root down-regulated category, most DEGs belong to the peroxidase and cytochrome P450 super families.

Moreover, seven peroxidase genes were observed in shoot up-regulated DEGs (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S6</xref>), indicating opposite peroxidase expression trends between root and shoot tissues under the microgravity environment for Bd21.</p><p>Next, we expanded our GO enrichment analysis to DEGs identified in all three accessions analyzed in this project.

This result suggests that Brachypodium Bd21 shoots display expression responses to the microgravity environment on ISS that are similar to those displayed by Arabidopsis plants exposed to redox perturbations associated with defects in the GUN retrograde signaling pathway [<xref rid="B54-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>We performed a similar analysis in the Bd21-3 and Gaz8 accessions (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>; <xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S9</xref>). Arabidopsis orthologs to Bd21-3 shoot DEGs associated with ROS signaling clustered preferentially with group-3 of the ROS wheel, representing early responses to high-light conditions, although this association did not reach statistical significance (chi-squared test; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.54). For Gaz8, Arabidopsis orthologs to shoot DEGs preferentially clustered with both groups 1 and 3 of the ROS wheel (<xref rid="life-13-00626-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>; chi-squared test; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 9.79 &#215; 10<sup>&#8722;11</sup>). Together, these puzzling results suggest the existence of accession-specific responses to oxidative stress under microgravity conditions possibly triggered by differential organ sensitivities to distinct microgravity environment-related stimuli. Our results also suggest that Brachypodium seedlings grown under microgravity condition may use the retrograde signaling pathway to modulate their responses to the microgravity-related stressors and acclimate accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-life-13-00626"><title>3.4.

Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we describe the morphological and transcriptomic changes displayed by the seedlings of three <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> accessions in response to the microgravity conditions of ISS relative to ground controls. Microgravity-exposed seedlings of all three accessions displayed shorter roots than ground controls, a phenotype that was previously reported for other plant species such as Cress [<xref rid="B79-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], wheat [<xref rid="B80-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], and Arabidopsis [<xref rid="B16-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. It is however important to note that a decrease in primary root length in response to microgravity is not a general plant response, as other reports have indicated increases in root length for microgravity-exposed seedlings in flax, rice, and soybean [<xref rid="B29-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B81-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,<xref rid="B82-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,<xref rid="B83-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,<xref rid="B84-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The reasons for such variations in root growth responses to microgravity are not known, although differences in genotypes and growth conditions may be responsible. Some of the gene-expression responses to the microgravity environments uncovered in this study may provide some clues, though. Indeed, genes annotated as regulating cell wall extensibility such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase (<italic toggle="yes">Bradi1g27867</italic>) and expansins (<italic toggle="yes">Bradi1g74720, Bradi3g50740, Bradi3g50730,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Bradi3g27440</italic>), were down-regulated in Bd21 Brachypodium roots under microgravity conditions (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S2</xref>). Interestingly, knockout mutations in Arabidopsis orthologs to these genes have been reported to restrict cell wall extensibility and limit cell expansion and root elongation [<xref rid="B85-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>,<xref rid="B86-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Similarly, we observed a tendency for many ribosomal-related genes to decrease in expression in Brachypodium roots under microgravity conditions relative to ground controls in Gaz8 accession (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Table S13</xref>). Previous studies using Arabidopsis cell cultures demonstrated a correlation between ribosomal biogenesis and cell growth, observing a depletion in both processes under both microgravity conditions or simulated microgravity [<xref rid="B69-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,<xref rid="B70-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Unfortunately, our experiments were not set up to allow observation of cell numbers in the root apical meristem, or cell elongation in the root elongation zone. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the short-root phenotype displayed by Brachypodium seedlings exposed to microgravity derive from decreased cell proliferation in the root apical meristem or altered cell elongation in the elongation zone.</p><p>Our transcriptomic analysis of Brachypodium responses to the microgravity environment on the ISS differentiated between shoot and root responses. This allowed us to demonstrate dramatic differences in expression responses between shoots and roots for all three Brachypodium accessions analyzed. In fact, only 3% of the DEGs identified in this study were similarly differentially expressed between root and shoot samples. Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis of these DEGs uncovered distinct major GO groups as enriched in shoot and root DEGs, respectively. The few GO groups that were similarly over-represented between shoot and root DEGs included genes that showed opposite expression responses to the microgravity environment between organs, as nicely documented by the expression differences between shoots and roots for distinct subgroups of peroxidase genes belonging to the Oxidative-Reduction Process GO group in Bd21 (<xref rid="app1-life-13-00626" ref-type="app">Supplemental Figure S6</xref>). These results are compatible with those reported for <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings exposed to microgravity [<xref rid="B6-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They suggest that the roots and shoots of young Brachypodium or Arabidopsis seedlings develop distinct response strategies to cope with the constraints dictated by exposure to the microgravity environment on ISS. Alternatively, it is also possible that the roots and shoots of young seedlings exposed to microgravity are subject to different environmental constraints imposed by their distinct functional contributions to plant development.</p><p>Similar models can be proposed to explain the vastly distinct transcriptional responses to microgravity displayed by the three Brachypodium accessions analyzed in this study. These accessions evolved under distinct conditions in different ecosystems within the Mediterranean area [<xref rid="B87-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. The varying selective pressures they encountered during their evolutionary history led to distinct genotypes that likely favored their adaptation to their native environment. When transferred to a new environment such as the microgravity conditions on the ISS, plants belonging to distinct accessions are differentially equipped to respond to these new constraints, leading to diverging root and shoot expression profiles along with differential growth and/or morphological responses. Larger-scale investigations of root and shoot growth and expression responses to microgravity of multiple Brachypodium accessions using genome-wide association studies should, in the longer term, provide exciting new information on key loci contributing to this variation in morphological and molecular adaptive responses to microgravity.</p><p>Plants have been identified as key components of bioregenerative life-support systems for long-term space-exploration missions. This is in large part due to their ability to photosynthesize, thereby recycling CO<sub>2</sub> and wastewater to produce O<sub>2</sub>, carbohydrates, and other biological molecules necessary for plant growth and development. The resulting biomass will constitute a significant source of food, feed, and fiber for the crew. Our data indicate that many photosynthesis-related genes are down-regulated in Brachypodium seedling shoots under microgravity conditions. We showed that such transcriptional responses of photosynthesis-related genes to the microgravity environment of ISS may be associated with oxidative stress exposure leading to an activation of the GUS retrograde signaling pathway and/or activation of <italic toggle="yes">PIF</italic> gene expression. It is interesting to note that hypergravity exposure, which leads to a strengthening of the cell wall, has recently been associated with increased chloroplast size, photosynthesis, and plant growth in moss, possibly reflecting a source&#8211;sink link between photosynthesis and carbohydrate utilization in cell wall restructuring [<xref rid="B88-life-13-00626" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>].

Therefore, future work will focus on investigating possible mechanistic connections between gravity and microgravity exposure, retrograde signaling between plastids and nucleus, PIF-mediated signaling, photosynthesis, wall restructuring, and carbohydrate metabolism.</p><p>In conclusion, our morphological and transcriptomic study of space-grown Brachypodium seedlings provides new insights into monocot plant responses to spaceflight. Because a 1&#215; <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> centrifugation control was not available on ISS for the VEGGIE growth chamber, the responses to spaceflight observed in this project cannot be unambiguously assigned to microgravity exposure. Indeed, some of these responses may also result from exposure to other spaceflight-associated parameters such as radiation, inefficient airflow, high ethylene levels, and/or other experimental parameters.</p><p>Some of the responses to spaceflight displayed by <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> seedlings are similar to those from <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seedlings, including oxidative stress response, decreased expression of photosynthesis-related genes, and wall restructuring. Those types of general responses also appear to be common between <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> accessions. We also observed some transcriptional responses to microgravity conditions that are more specific to <italic toggle="yes">Brachypodium distachyon</italic> accessions, suggesting a specificity of response that may be expected from plant populations that have been subjected to distinct evolutionary constraints and are now subjected to a totally new environment (microgravity).</p><p>Our studies focused on the early stages of seedling development, and it will be important to evaluate the contribution of the identified responses to spaceflight at later phases of plant development and reproduction. A careful evaluation of the contribution of each response, general or specific, to the microgravity environment and its significance for plant survival, growth, and productivity under microgravity should lead to the design of better cultivars and/or cultivation methodologies to produce crops with improved potential for use as key components of bioregenerative life support systems for long-term space-exploration missions. Furthermore, the existence of distinct molecular responses to the microgravity environment between species, and between accessions within species, suggests the need to expand these types of studies directly to cultivated crop species of potential use during spaceflight.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the flight support team and the project managers at Kennedy Space Center and the astronauts for all the help in making this project possible.
