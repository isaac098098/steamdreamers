During pregnancy and lactation, an immense demand for nutrients sustains these challenging physiological states in the mother and fosters growth and development of the fetus and neonate. To support fetal and neonatal growth, major changes in the partitioning of available nutrients occur in maternal tissues, including coordinated shifts in mammary, liver and adipose tissue metabolism that do not jeopardize maternal homeostasis or fetal and neonatal health (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Bauman and Currie, 1980</xref>). Homeorhetic adaptations are the &#8220;coordinated changes in metabolism of body tissues necessary to support a (dominant) developmental or physiological process&#8221; (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">Bauman and Currie, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Bell and Bauman, 1997</xref>). Whereas homeostasis is widely understood to describe compensatory mechanisms that preserve the relative constancy of functions despite external challenges, homeorhesis refers to regulatory processes that support developmental or physiological processes of highest priority (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Bauman et al., 1982</xref>). Homeorhetic controls regulate nutrient partitioning during pregnancy, thereby assuring growth of the conceptus as well as development of the mammary gland. With the onset of lactation, many maternal tissues undergo further adaptations to support milk synthesis.</p><p>During gestation, the endocrine system coordinates the mother's metabolic activities with the physiological requirements of the fetuses and subsequent nutritional demands of the suckling offspring. Mammary gland development and differentiation during pregnancy is the direct result of a network of changes in hormone levels, substrate availability and behavioral adaptations that collectively result in optimal milk production during lactation. During pregnancy, estrogen, progesterone, placental lactogen and the anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin (PRL), stimulate mammary growth and differentiation. At parturition, changes in these hormones act to stimulate the onset of lactation (<xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr">Tucker, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">Neville et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>). Periparturient changes in maternal metabolism include: 1) increased hepatic gluconeogenesis from endogenous substrates, 2) decreased peripheral tissue glucose utilization, 3) increased fatty acid mobilization from adipose tissue, and 4) increased amino acid mobilization from muscle (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Chaves and Herrera, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">Martin-Hidalgo et al., 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">Bell, 1995</xref>). Thus to insure adequate milk production and simultaneously maintain maternal homeostasis, the lactating dam utilizes homeorhetic processes to shift her metabolism.</p><p>The dam's normal homeorhetic response to the increased nutrient and energy demands of milk synthesis were mediated in part by global changes in gene transcription in mammary, liver and adipose including changes in clock genes that regulate circadian rhythms (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Casey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b54" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2011</xref>). Changes in molecular clocks during the transition from pregnancy to lactation in relation to other transcriptional profiles of mammary, liver and adipose tissues suggested that homeorhetic adaptation to lactation may be by coordinated in part by the circadian system. Circadian rhythms allow organisms to anticipate and prepare for precise and regular environmental changes and can be entrained by external cues (<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">Hastings et al., 2007</xref>). Although light is the primary environmental cue that entrains circadian clocks, gravity significantly affects circadian patterns of behavior, hormones, body temperature, and metabolism (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Czeisler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">Whitson et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">Murakami and Fuller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Fuller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Dijk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">Holley et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Gravity is an environmental stimulus that exerts major influences on animal physiology and behavior (<xref rid="b67" ref-type="bibr">Sonnenfeld, 2005</xref>). Similar to other environmental stimuli, such as temperature and light, animals have adapted to the Earth's gravitational force. In mammals, sudden deviations from Earth's 1-g environment are associated with significant physiological changes, including altered reproductive capability (<xref rid="b68" ref-type="bibr">Tou et al., 2002</xref>). Studies investigating the effects of gravity and circadian rhythms on reproducing and developing mammals can provide unique biomedical perspectives on these life processes on Earth (<xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">Ronca, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We previously identified gravity as an environmental variable that produces major graded changes in mammary metabolic activity and reduces pup survival (<xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">Ronca et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">Plaut et al., 2003</xref>). We and others showed that survival rates of pups born to rat dams exposed to 1.5- to 2-times Earth's gravity during the latter half of pregnancy were reduced by 5 to 40% (<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">Megory and Oyama, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">Ronca et al., 2001</xref>). However, if neonatal pups were removed from the hypergravity environment and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2000</xref>). These data suggest that the dam's normal homeorhetic response to the onset of lactation was altered in hypergravity, thereby decreasing her ability to nurture pups. Although HG dams had reduced body fat and mass, these factors did not account for altered rates of lipid metabolism in mammary, liver and adipose tissues or decreased neonatal survival (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Lintault et al., 2007</xref>). Further, neither prolactin nor glucocorticoid supplementation reversed the HG induced reduction in metabolic rates, suggesting that factors other than circulating lactogenic hormone levels and dam body composition were negatively impacting the dams' homeorhetic response to pregnancy and lactation (<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate a disruption of homeorhetic mechanisms that normally allow the dam to maintain homeostasis while simultaneously providing for growing fetuses and neonates.</p><p>In the present study, we measured the effect of exposure to 2-g from mid-gestation (gestational day [G]11 of the rat's 22-day pregnancy) throughout early lactation (until Postnatal day [P]3) on metabolic activity of mammary, liver and adipose tissue as well as circulating hormone and metabolite levels, and maternal behavior in relation to pup survival. We tested whether hypergravity affects homeorhetic responses in the dam thereby affecting lipid metabolism and pup survival. We also examined the hypothesis that alterations to the dam's circadian system induced by changes in gravitational force may limit homeorhetic adaptations needed for a successful lactation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effects of gravity load on dam body mass, organ mass, and body composition</title><p>Body mass was 21%, 19%, 10%, 17% and 13% lower in G20, G21, P0, P1 and P3 HG dams versus control dams, respectively (supplementary&#8197;material Table S1).

The presence of a similar number of fetuses and live births at the normal delivery time between treatments suggest that prenatal development continues to proceed in HG. However, 24&#8197;hours after birth survival was significantly reduced. Reduced pup survival was likely due to changes in maternal-pup interactions or changes in maternal physiology, as when pups were removed from the hypergravity environment at birth and cross fostered to non-manipulated dams, mortality did not occur (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2000</xref>). Thus the present study focused on the behavioral and physiological status of the dams during the periparturient period.</p><p>During the first 24&#8197;hours after birth, approximately 50% of the pups survived at 2-g. Pup mortality coincided with altered maternal behavior in HG animals, which was marked by less time digging/nesting behavior and self-care (eating, drinking and grooming). These observations are consistent with previous reports of periparturient rats exposed to 1.5-g (<xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">Ronca et al., 2001</xref>), and may reflect a reduction in types of behaviors that require effort against the gravity vector.</p><p>HG dams also spent significantly more time nursing, which is consistent with our previous observation that primiparous dams exposed to hypergravity spend more overall time nursing with increased interruption of nursing bouts due to digging/nest-building behavior (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Pups of HG dams showed evidence of milk in the stomach (visualized through the pups' translucent skin), although limited analysis of milk bands revealed that they weighed less than the controls. Maternal care of pups in the hypergravity environment was intact as measured by licking, retrieving and nursing pups. It is not clear whether increased nursing may have contributed to pup mortality, for example by smothering pups during extended nursing bouts. Increased nursing time and smaller milk bands may reflect complications with lactation or inefficient milk transfer. Focus was therefore directed at alterations in dam metabolism specifically geared toward lactation.</p><p>Dams exposed to 2-g had significantly reduced body mass, 17% less than controls, and the reduction in body mass persisted throughout the study. Dam body mass decreased during the first 3 days of hypergravity exposure due to reduced daily food and water intake. After 3 days the animals acclimated to the hypergravity, food intake increased and weight gain rate became similar to controls (for details, see <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Lintault et al., 2007</xref>). Although the litters from HG dams were 20% smaller, it only accounted for 8g (7g for pups and 1g due to placental mass) of the total the difference in average dam mass (59g) between the treatments (supplementary&#8197;material Table S1). Therefore the majority of difference in dam body mass was not due to the smaller litters, rather it was due to loss of maternal tissue, as was evident in mammary glands, which were significantly smaller in HG dams on G20 and accounted for approximately 4g of tissue loss. Hypergravity exposure resulted in a significant decrease in the mean size of adipocytes (data not shown), and overall reduction in total body fat of dams (for details, see <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">Lintault et al., 2007</xref>). The reduction in dam body fat is likely due to increased energy demands in the hypergravity environment, and may cause a conflict between meeting maternal and pup energy needs.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Exposure to HG during pregnancy and lactation overrides normal metabolic response to the reproductive cycle</title><p>As anticipated, mammary metabolic rate increased from pregnancy to lactation in both HG and control dams. However, hypergravity exposure decreased lipid synthesis by approximately 70% and glucose oxidation by approximately 25% at all stages, which is consistent with our previous findings (<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">Plaut et al., 1999a</xref>; <xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">Plaut et al., 2003</xref>). The reduction in mammary metabolism may play a significant role in neonatal mortality. Analysis of expression of genes that regulate lipid metabolic rate: ATP-citrate lyase (<italic toggle="yes">Acly</italic>), acetyl co-A carboxylase (<italic toggle="yes">Acaca</italic>), fatty acid synthetase (<italic toggle="yes">Fasn</italic>) and lipoprotein lipase (<italic toggle="yes">Lpl)</italic> revealed a dramatic increase from late pregnancy to the first day of lactation in mammary gland of control dams. However, the change in gene expression between late pregnancy and the first day of lactation was greatly diminished in mammary tissue from HG treated dams relative to control dams. These data suggest that the decrease in mammary lipid metabolic rate and suppression of genes involved in lipid metabolism resulted in impaired milk production in HG dams. Mammary composition was not evaluated in our study, but it may have affected mammary metabolic output. For example milk production is believed to be a function of the number and secretory activity of epithelial cells (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">Knight and Peaker, 1982</xref>), so if there was less parenchymal tissue in HG dams, it would be expected that they have a decreased ability to produce milk. Secondly, the first fat for milk synthesis is likely mobilized from what is remaining of the mammary fat pad during the early postpartum period (<xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">Rudolph et al., 2007</xref>), and thus a lower mammary fat content may limit the energy content of milk.</p><p>To determine whether the metabolic response was limited to mammary tissue or if it also occurred in tissues that worked in concert with mammary tissue during lactation, glucose metabolism was measured in adipose and liver tissue. Our data demonstrate that both g-load and gestation day influenced glucose metabolism in adipose tissue. Increased gravity-load decreased metabolic rate in adipose tissue, including rate of lipolysis during lactation. Adipose tissue is a major source of metabolic fuel stored as triglycerides (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#252;hbeck et al., 2001</xref>), and at the onset of lactation, fat depots are mobilized through an increased rate of lipolysis, which accommodates the high energy demands of milk synthesis in the mammary gland (<xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">Williamson, 1986</xref>). Lower rates of adipose tissue metabolism in the hypergravity environment may be indicative of limited supplies of triglycerides for milk fat synthesis.</p><p>During lactation glucose oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> in liver tissue of HG dams was less than in control dams. The rate of glucose incorporation into lipid increased almost 4-fold from late pregnancy to the onset of lactation in control dams, demonstrating the increase in hepatic capacity at the onset of lactation to supply fatty acids to the mammary gland for milk synthesis (<xref rid="b73" ref-type="bibr">Williamson, 1980</xref>; <xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">Williamson, 1986</xref>). This increase did not occur in HG dams, which had suppressed rates of glucose incorporation into lipids compared to controls during lactation. At the molecular level expression of the lipid metabolic genes <italic toggle="yes">Acaca</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Acly</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Fasn</italic> were lower in liver tissue from HG versus control dams on the first day of lactation. Together, metabolic data revealed that exposure to increased gravity load caused a decrease in the capacity to oxidize glucose or incorporate glucose into lipid in all three tissues during lactation. This shift in tissue metabolic capacity is likely indicative of an extra energy investment in the hypergravity environment that overrides the normal maternal homeorhetic adaptation to lactation.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Alteration of lactogenic hormone levels during exposure to hypergravity are not likely primary cause of hypergravity induced changes in maternal behavior and tissue metabolism</title><p>The regulation of metabolism in the lactating rats, in particular milk production, is dependent on PRL, cortisol, INS, and thyroid hormones (<xref rid="b74" ref-type="bibr">Williamson, 1986</xref>). In the present study there were no significant alterations in thyroid hormone concentrations. In an earlier study, we reported TSH to be elevated only at one time-point post-delivery (P15) with no other differences noted over time in TSH, T3 or T4 (<xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">Sajdel-Sulkowska et al., 2001</xref>). Therefore, it appears that thyroid status does not contribute to alterations in maternal metabolism or behavior leading to reduced pup survival.</p><p>Surprisingly, PRL concentrations were significantly higher at P0 in HG dams but not different from controls at any other time-point, although the data were extremely variable. The higher plasma PRL levels may reflect the lower expression of <italic toggle="yes">Prlr</italic> in HG dams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f04">Fig.&#8197;4</xref>) since low receptor levels may trigger PRL secretion (<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">Holcomb et al., 1976</xref>; <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Durand and Djiane, 1977</xref>) or may be an effort by the body to increase receptor levels, as PRL is known to auto-induce its own receptor at delivery (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">McNeilly and Friesen, 1977</xref>). In contrast to our study, others reported reduced PRL levels in pregnant and lactating dams exposed to hypergravity (<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">Megory and Oyama, 1984</xref>; <xref rid="b48a" ref-type="bibr">Megory and Oyama, 1985</xref>; <xref rid="b2a" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2002</xref>). Discrepancy in results among studies may be due to variations in sampling times in relation to parturition, suckling or circadian rhythms. Thus it is unclear if the observed treatment differences in PRL concentrations contribute to the differences in maternal behavior, pup mortality, or metabolic rate between control and HG dams. Although, it is important to note that our previous study showed daily PRL administration could not reverse impact of hypergravity on tissue metabolic rate (<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Plasma Cort levels were significantly reduced in HG compared to control dams at all time-points. Decreased levels of plasma Cort in HG dams coincide with changes in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis in mammary, liver and adipose tissue. However, it is not likely that lower Cort levels caused these changes, as when HG treated pregnant rat dams were supplemented with Cort, we found no effect on rates of glucose oxidation or lipogenesis in any of the three tissues (<xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al., 2008</xref>), thus indicating that the lower levels of Cort alone do not cause the observed alterations in rates of glucose oxidation and lipogenesis.</p><p>INS levels were significantly less in lactating HG treated animals compared to controls. Lower INS concentrations accompanied no change in plasma glucose concentrations, suggesting an increase in INS sensitivity in hypergravity, as the glucose to INS ratio was greater. LEP levels were also significantly less in lactating HG treated dams, which corresponded with the significantly lower circulating levels of cholesterol and triglyceride as well as reduced body fat in these dams on P3. Serum levels of LEP reflect the amount of energy stored in adipose tissue as well as short-term energy imbalance. Hormonal factors also regulate LEP levels. LEP functions to communicate the status of energy reserves with the central nervous system for the purpose of regulating metabolic stores (<xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">Rosenbaum et al., 2001</xref>). Thus the lower levels of LEP are consistent with the other changes observed in HG including reduced body fat stores, and decreased INS and Cort concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Changes in circadian clocks relative to changes in metabolism, endocrine milieu and behavior</title><p>Our previous studies and findings in this study suggest regulatory mechanisms outside of the endocrine system are causing the alterations to the normal maternal homeorhetic response to lactation in the hypergravity environment. Homeorhetic adaptations are time dependent changes in metabolism to establish a new physiological state, such as pregnancy or lactation. Likewise the ability of animals to adapt to changes in their environment including photoperiod, heat, stress, gravity and nutrition also require time-dependent integrative homeorhetic regulation (D.E. Bauman, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, personal communication). Recently, we put forth the hypothesis that during the periparturient period, the circadian system mediates homeorhetic adaptations to lactation (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Casey et al., 2009</xref>). We envision that during this period the central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei integrates environmental and physiological cues that it receives. In turn, the central clock responds to these cues and coordinates behavioral and physiological changes across the dams by sending humoral and neural signals to multiple tissues, which stimulate changes in core molecular clocks of peripheral tissues including endocrine glands, mammary, and liver. Changes to the core clocks in turn effectively change the proteome and metabolome of the dam to support lactation. In addition, it is probable that the dam's capacity to produce milk and cope with metabolic stress during lactation is related to her ability to set circadian rhythms.</p><p>Chronic exposure to hypergravity has pronounced effects on circadian and homeostatic regulation of body temperature, activity, heart rate, and feeding (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">Murakami and Fuller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">Robinson and Fuller, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">Warren et al., 2000</xref>). Exposure of adult male mice to 2g hypergravity caused an immediate 4-day loss in circadian rhythm in both core body temperature and activity. Acclimation to hypergravity resulted in recovery of circadian rhythms with new, but lower, basal levels of temperature and activity (<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">Murakami and Fuller, 2000</xref>). Similar to findings in adult male mice, our analysis of circadian behavioral data revealed hypergravity exposed pregnant females spent the first 5 days acclimating to the environment and were in a state of hypoactivity during the dark, but not the light phase of the cycle. However, in late pregnancy, day 20 and 21, HG dams became hyperactive relative control dams, suggesting that impact of gravity load on circadian behavior was dependent on physiological state of dams.</p><p>Offspring of homozygous female <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> mutant mice, which have a genetic mutation that disrupts circadian rhythms, fail to thrive. <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> mutant dams are deficient nest builders and exhibited disrupted nursing.

Our findings derived from HG dams reveal some major parallels with <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> mutant dams. First, there was a dampening of circadian cyclicity in overall activity beginning 24&#8197;h after HG exposure. Second, HG dams had lower nursing bout durations coupled with greater numbers of nursing bouts, and an aberrant pattern of digging/nest-building activity. Third, offspring body weights lagged in the HG condition and pup mortality was significantly increased. Finally post-weaning obesity has been reported in <italic toggle="yes">Clock</italic> offspring (<xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr">Turek et al., 2005</xref>), and we previously reported significantly elevated body weights in post-weaning rats reared during HG exposure (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2005</xref>). Collectively, these findings provide initial support for the hypothesis that disruptions in the circadian timing system underlie the reported gravity-related changes in maternal behavior and offspring development.</p><p>Examination of differences in expression of core clock genes and genes that regulate molecular clocks in mammary and liver, suggest that hypergravity exposure impacted molecular clocks that generate circadian rhythms. Since data were only available for one time-point on each day, it is not known how circadian rhythms were affected by hypergravity, and thus observed differences between treatments may be indicative of changes in rhythm amplitude, phase or period. Differences in endocrine milieu in hypergravity treated dams may also be indicative of changes in the circadian system. Exposure to microgravity causes shifts in circadian rhythms and increases basal levels of cortisol in humans and rodents (<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">Grigoriev et al., 1987</xref>; <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">Dijk et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">Macho et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">Macho et al., 2001a</xref>). Preflight circadian adaptation countermeasures revealed that altered lighting schedules during spaceflight caused phase shifts in plasma hormone rhythms; however, changes in basal cortisol levels were a result of alterations in gravity load (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Czeisler et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">Whitson et al., 1995</xref>). Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that changes in basal cortisol due to changes in gravitational force are analogous, but distinct, from the circadian system mediated seasonal changes in hormone levels that are governed by changes in photoperiod length (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">Lincoln and Richardson, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Dardente, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">Ebling and Barrett, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>), and may quite possibly be mediated through a hypothalmic-vestibular connection (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">Fuller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="b50" ref-type="bibr">Murakami et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Endogenous clocks enable organisms to anticipate periodic changes in the environment and to adapt their physiology accordingly. The transition from pregnancy to lactation represents a major physiological change requiring coordinated adjustments in physiology and metabolism to support milk production. Previous studies from our lab revealed that changes in molecular clocks are coordinated among multiple tissues during the transition from pregnancy to lactation, and suggest that the circadian system may be important in coordinating the metabolic and hormonal changes needed to initiate and sustain lactation. Homeorhetic adaptations to lactation can be affected by physiological and environmental factors. Photoperiod is an example of an environmental factor that affects energy balance, reproduction and lactation (<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">Dahl et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Lincoln et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Duncan, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">Dardente et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">Silveyra et al., 2010</xref>). Photoperiodic information is received and integrated across the circadian system, which effectively coordinates the animal's physiology and metabolome to photoperiod length, including seasonal changes in milk quality and quantity. Similarly, we propose that hypergravity induced alterations in homeorhetic adaptations to lactation including changes in dam metabolic capacity and behavior are due to the impact of increased gravity load on circadian clocks. Changes in circadian clocks affect output of multiple organs resulting in reduced quality and quantity of milk and therefore decreased pup survival in the hypergravity environment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals and treatment conditions</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the NASA Ames Research Center IACUC. Sixty-four time-bred female Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic toggle="yes">Rattus norvegicus</italic>; Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY, USA), weighing between 190&#8211;280g, were used. Animals were assigned to one of five stages (n&#8202;=&#8202;16 per group) corresponding to different time-points across the periparturient period. These were: G20, G21, P0 (birth), P1 (onset of lactation) and P3 (lactation day 3). During the period G2&#8211;G6, the dams were individually housed in maternity cages (47cm &#215;26cm &#215;21cm) lined with corncob bedding and maintained under standard colony conditions (12&#8758;12 light/dark cycle [0600&#8758;1800]; 21&#177;1&#176;C at 30&#8211;50% humidity). On G7, the dams were housed in custom designed metabolic cages allowing for the clean separation of urine and feces for collection and analysis. Standard rat chow (Purina #5012, pellets in maternity cages and powdered in metabolic cages) and water were available <italic toggle="yes">ad libitum.</italic> On G9, dams were assigned to the either hypergravity (HG) (n&#8202;=&#8202;8) or control (n&#8202;=&#8202;8) conditions with body weights matched across groups. Hypergravity (HG) dams were placed on the NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) 24 ft centrifuge and exposed to continuous 2-g (20.1&#8197;rpm). The centrifuge was stopped daily (approximately 1h duration) for animal maintenance, veterinary inspection and data collection. Control dams were housed in the metabolic cages in the same room as the experimental dams. Both groups were therefore exposed to identical environmental conditions (light, sound, temperature, and humidity). On G21, the day prior to birth, dams were transferred from metabolic cages to standard maternity cages. Real time videography onboard the rotating centrifuge was used to identify the precise time of birth for each dam. For the P0 group, the centrifuge was briefly (&lt;15&#8197;min) stopped three times per day at eight hr intervals to retrieve dams that were undergoing labor contractions or birth. For the P1 group, animals were retrieved within 18 to 36&#8197;h following birth. In polytocous species, milk yield and body weight gain per pup are inversely related to litter size (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">Kumaresan et al., 1967</xref>). Therefore, on P1, HG and control litters were yoked and their sizes adjusted so that numbers and genders of pups comprising each litter were matched across conditions. Litter size was further adjusted daily by noting the numbers of dead or missing neonates in HG litters, and then removing the equivalent number of offspring from the corresponding control litter. Gender composition of the matched HG litter was preserved in litter adjustments. Animals were euthanized at the same time of day in both groups to account for circadian variations.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Dam body mass, organ mass and body composition</title><p>Dams in each condition were weighed daily throughout the study. Dam body composition was analyzed using TOBEC&#174; (Total Body Electrical Conductivity) instrumentation (EM-SCAN Inc., Springfield, IL, USA) just prior to euthanasia. Briefly, the TOBEC&#174; instrument measures energy absorption in the presence of a radio-frequency electromagnetic field, calibrated to match the response of a conductivity sensing element. Energy absorption is increased in conductive materials (i.e., hydrated, lean tissue) as compared to highly resistive materials (i.e., fur, body fat) (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">Harrison and Van Itallie, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Bracco et al., 1983</xref>; <xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">Presta et al., 1983</xref>).

Therefore, glycerol release, rather than glucose incorporation into lipids, was measured. Adipose slices were placed in Krebs-Ringer Buffer in the absence of INS and incubated for 2&#8197;h. Media and tissue were collected and frozen. Glycerol released into media was measured using an enzymatic assay (R-Biopharm, Inc., Cat.

Preliminary studies were also performed to validate metabolic rate measures in liver and adipose tissue. Optimal buffer choice, tris-sucrose or saline, and the temperature at which to hold the tissues (4&#176;C, 37&#176;C) prior to the assay were also determined. Optimal incubation time for these two tissues was determined by comparing metabolic rates following 1, 2, 3 or 4h of incubation. As shown by Etherton and Allen (<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">Etherton and Allen, 1980</xref>), it was necessary to keep adipose tissue warm (37&#176;C) in a saline solution prior to assay to prevent tissue hardening and death. Adipose tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 2h of incubation. Activity reached a plateau and then began to decline after 2&#8211;3h. Therefore, optimal measures of adipose tissue metabolism were obtained after 2&#8197;h of incubation. Optimal buffer and holding temperature for liver prior to assay were determined to be tris-sucrose buffer on ice. Liver tissue metabolic activity increased linearly for 4&#8211;5h of incubation, thus liver tissue was incubated for 4h to measure metabolism. In addition, numerous studies utilizing metabolic assays to study toxicology and drug metabolism have determined that liver slices incubated for at least 4h and up to 20h remain viable during this time (<xref rid="b66" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 1985</xref>; <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">Dogterom, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Ekins, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">de Graaf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">Maas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">de Graaf et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Isolation of total RNA and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTq-PCR)</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from mammary, liver and adipose tissue collected from G20 and P1 HG-treated and control dams and used to analyze gene expression of lipid metabolic enzymes and hormone receptors using RTq-PCR.
