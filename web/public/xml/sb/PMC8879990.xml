Introduction</title><p>A long-duration mission to Mars will require humans to live in space for up to 2.5 years. The distance of Mars from Earth changes with planetary physics limiting launch opportunities and preventing resupply. Consequently, food may have to be sent years ahead of the crew. Shelf-stable food systems may be five years old by the end of the mission. Under expected ambient storage conditions, critical nutrients and quality factors may degrade over this period of time [<xref rid="B1-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This possibility creates a critical risk to the provision of adequate food and nutrition to support crew health and performance through such missions. Food crops grown in-mission have the potential to supplement crew nutritional requirements and to act as a psychological countermeasure for the crew by providing a familiar aspect of Earth in the isolation and confinement of deep space [<xref rid="B3-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, seeds and plant growth supplies may also have to be sent ahead of the crew and would need to remain viable for the length of the mission. Deep-space radiation is one of the major factors that could impact the viability of food crops.</p><p>Deep-space radiation is composed primarily of protons released from large solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). GCR consists of approximately 85&#8211;90% protons, and 10&#8211;13% helium ions (alpha particles), with the remaining 1&#8211;2% consisting of high atomic number and energy (HZE) nuclei particles and electrons [<xref rid="B4-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, astronauts and other organisms onboard these deep space missions will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to protons from SPEs. Life on Earth is well protected from these components of deep-space radiation for two reasons: (1) the Earth&#8217;s global magnetic field deflects energetic charged particles, and (2) Earth&#8217;s atmosphere interacts with them resulting in attenuated energy levels and secondary particles [<xref rid="B5-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, during a mission beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), living organisms will be exposed to more intense deep-space radiation, in addition to secondary particles generated by the shielding materials, the atmosphere, and regolith if near the Lunar or Martian surface.</p><p>During a long-term deep space mission, it is expected that crew members in space will be exposed to 1&#8211;2 mSv/day dose equivalent rate of GCR and approximately half this amount on planetary surfaces [<xref rid="B6-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Even though the flux levels of GCR particles are very low, GCR contains high linear energy transfer (LET) particles that produce intense ionization as they penetrate through matter. Compared to low LET radiation (e.g., gamma radiation), the estimated average biological effectiveness (or the quality factor) of radiation received on the Martian surface and during transit are 3.05 and 3.82, respectively, primarily due to the Martian atmosphere [<xref rid="B6-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The effective Mars atmospheric shielding is about 21 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is much thicker than the spacecraft shielding of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)&#8217;s Curiosity Rover during its transportation from Earth to Mars [<xref rid="B7-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For Lunar missions, there is no atmospheric shielding effect. Using data obtained during the MSL mission, it was estimated that a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 Sv would be experienced during a round trip Mars surface mission consisting of a 180-day transit (each way) and 500 days on the Martian surface with solar activity similar to that of 2011&#8211;2012 [<xref rid="B7-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. For plant seeds, these dose equivalent rates and quality factors may not be applicable because they refer to the biological effectiveness of a given absorbed dose of a specific type of radiation based on human tissue responses. Therefore, in this study, we designed the experiment based on the measurements of the absorbed dose during the MSL mission, which is 400&#8211;560 &#181;Gy/day during transit and 170&#8211;250 &#181;Gy/day on the Martian surface at the Gale crater region [<xref rid="B7-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>At the cellular level, radiation induces DNA damage, which to some extent is successfully handled by cellular repair machinery. To counteract DNA damage, a network of cellular pathways, defined as the DNA damage response (DDR) network, mitigates DNA damage by detecting and repairing DNA lesions. These mechanisms consist of cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The basic DDR networks in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar, but significant differences exist in the radiosensitivity among different species and the mechanisms that allow access to the lesions by repair enzymes [<xref rid="B9-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Plants share many features of chromatin organization and DNA repair with fungi and animals [<xref rid="B9-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that the effect of ionizing radiation on plants depends upon species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure [<xref rid="B11-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and on other venues beyond LEO [<xref rid="B12-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], however, the radiation environment reported in most of these published studies is not comparable to deep- space radiation, neither in quality nor quantity. Therefore, whether crop seeds, plant growth, and produce quality are significantly affected by long-term exposure to deep-space radiation has yet to be adequately investigated and characterized.</p><p>Although current Earth-based radiation facilities can only approximately reproduce the space-radiation environment, recent improvements in technology can be utilized to improve our knowledge about the effect of space radiation on crop plants [<xref rid="B15-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This information would in turn address the question of whether fresh food production could provide an important nutritional and psychological contribution on long-duration missions. In this study, two types of plant seeds were included. The first were seeds from <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> a model organism that does not have properties that would contribute to a bioregenerative or food capability, but which is currently the most extensively studied plant in spaceflight [<xref rid="B16-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] partially due to the availability of its whole genome sequence and a wide range of genetically modified strains. The second were seeds from an edible mustard plant, Mizuna, <italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa var. japonica</italic>, which has been identified as a candidate space crop and grown for research and crew consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) [<xref rid="B17-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Seeds from both species were irradiated, and subsequently planted and grown to seedlings to demonstrate the impact of the space radiation environment on seeds and their ability to germinate and develop. The range of outcomes between <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> and Mizuna indicates the potential challenges with transferring model organism information to usable systems, and a need to focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-life-12-00144"><title>2.

Radiation Scenarios</title><p>Selected radiation scenarios are summarized in <xref rid="life-12-00144-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Seeds, dry or imbibed, were exposed to protons and titanium ions individually, or using two simulated GCR scenarios (GCR1 or GCR2) and one simulated SPE event. For both GCR scenarios, ions including protons, helium, oxygen, titanium or silicon, and iron were sequentially delivered. GCR1 was a complex mixed radiation field with a similar spectrum of particles identified in GCR. This simulation was designed by Dr. Hada&#8217;s team and generated after the above primary beams passed through 20 g/cm<sup>2</sup> aluminum and high-density polyethylene at 10.345 g/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref rid="B21-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Under the GCR1 environment, seeds were exposed to a mixture of non-directional secondary particles in which 250 MeV/n protons predominated [<xref rid="B21-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The GCR2 scenario was a standard GCR simulation scenario provided by the NSRL physics team for space-radiation risk assessment research without the shielding material [<xref rid="B22-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Simulated SPE exposure was achieved using sequential exposures to protons with a broad energy range of 50&#8211;150 MeV/n, simulating the August 1972 SPE event [<xref rid="B22-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Exposures to all radiation scenarios were conducted acutely (within minutes for each single beam, leading to a total of about 20 min. for all particle components) or at a relatively low dose rate (LDR) over a 2&#8211;4 h time period (<xref rid="life-12-00144-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-life-12-00144"><title>2.3. Preparation of Seeds for Irradiation and Growth Study</title><p>Mizuna seeds were sanitized by 1 h-hypochlorite fuming (30 mL bleach: 0.5 mL HCL) [<xref rid="B24-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds were sanitized using a standard 70% ethanol method [<xref rid="B24-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Sanitized dry seeds for each condition were then transferred to packets prepared from sterile germination paper. For imbibed seed treatments, twenty-four hours before irradiation, 0.9 mL of water was added to each packet to imbibe the seeds, and seed packets with imbibed seeds were then wrapped with several more layers of brown kraft paper sheet to prevent light exposure. All the seed packets, each containing about 25 dry or imbibed seeds, were kept in the dark at approximately 4 &#176;C in a refrigerator, except during the periods of actual or sham (i.e., for controls) radiation exposures when both irradiated and control seed packets were still in the dark, but at room temperature.</p><p>Depending on the experimental conditions (<xref rid="life-12-00144-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), 26&#8211;72 dry or 24 h-imbibed <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> and Mizuna seeds were subject to each radiation exposure treatment, while similar numbers of seeds were retained as non-irradiated controls for comparison with acute or LDR irradiated seeds.</p><p>For evaluating germination and early seedling development, two days after irradiation, control and irradiated seeds were planted onto a 0.5% Murishige and Skoog (MS) phytogel media either individually within a pipette tip holder (titanium, proton, and GCR1 experiments) or six to twelve seeds within a 10 cm &#215; 10 cm Petri plate (GCR2 and SPE experiments) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Growth conditions approximating those on the ISS (except for CO<sub>2</sub> concentration) were maintained in a controlled environment chamber (22 &#176;C, 40&#8211;45% RH, 150 &#956;mol&#183;m<sup>2</sup>&#183;s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> light, ambient CO<sub>2</sub> at about 400 ppm, 16 h/8 h photoperiod). Seedlings were harvested at 6&#8211;7 days after planting (DAP) for <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>, and 5 DAP for Mizuna for morphological analyses. Images were acquired for evaluating signs of stress and deformation. Seeds were defined as having germinated upon observation of any early sign of germination, including seed coat rupture and radicle emergence. For purposes of assessing viability rates in seeds exposed to Ti-ion exposure, non-germinated seeds as well as germinated seeds without cotyledons, or with radical emergence or showing severely deformed cotyledons without sign of true leaf development were considered non-viable. Imagery analysis for determining cotyledon deformation was conducted only for Ti-ion irradiated <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings and mizuna experiments. In the titanium-ion irradiation experiment, deformation data were obtained for all seedlings; however, root length measurements for several seedlings were missing due to their roots being broken during the harvest. As a result, the number of plants available for analysis of root length was fewer than the number with deformation data for the titanium-ion experiment.

We also chose a higher dose point of 80 cGy for all simulated GCR irradiation experiments to evaluate the dose response and possible maximum GCR impact on seeds. For some experiments, 20 cGy exposures were used as well. Compared to GCR, the occurrence time, duration, and fluence of an SPE are not predictable. Therefore, for the SPE simulation, we used the model developed by the NSRL based on combining characteristics of two large historical events, namely the fluence of the August 1972 event along with an energy spectrum similar to the March 1989 event [<xref rid="B22-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

These dose points allow us to determine potential dose response and compare it with the GCR effects. Our study investigated two fundamental questions: (1) whether deep space GCR or SPE protons impacts plant seeds and their growth, and (2) which factors such as species, dose, dose rate, particle type, or some combination of these produce the most detrimental effects. Seeds received either acute exposure within 10&#8211;15 min (40&#8211;50 mGy/min), or relatively LDR exposures (1.66&#8211;3.33 mGy/min and 4.44 mGy/min for GCR and SPE, respectively). Due to facility constraints, the resulting LDR dose for simulated GCR is higher than the dose rate in deep space, but chronic exposure is more relevant in deep-space scenarios than is acute exposure.</p><sec id="sec4dot1-life-12-00144"><title>4.1. Charged Particle Exposure and Hydrated Arabidopsis Seeds</title><p>In the first part of this study, we chose hydrated <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds to expose to various single particles (protons and titanium ions), as well as the more complex GCR1 scenario. The GCR1 scenario was developed by Dr. Hada&#8217;s group [<xref rid="B21-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] using sequential primary beams and shielding materials to generate a complex mixed radiation field. This was the first time a simulated GCR scenario has been utilized for plant research.</p><p>Hydrated seeds contain growing embryos that are presumably more sensitive to radiation damage than dry seeds and mature plants, therefore, we expected the radiation impact, if any, would be shown in these hydrated seeds. In our study, the seeds were hydrated 24 h before irradiation and maintained at 4 &#176;C in the dark. This experimental condition was developed to maintain the seeds in a hydrated, but still relatively dormant stage, to avoid the influence of environmental fluctuations that might interfere with the seeds&#8217; responses to radiation. In particular, temperature can affect both the germination process and DNA repair efficiency. Another factor is the light level that hydrated seeds are exposed to before, during, and after irradiation. Light regimes have been shown to dictate the specific activation and efficiency of some DNA repair pathways such as recombination or photo-repair in various plants [<xref rid="B38-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].

However, morphological changes, especially on root length measurements, of the seedlings cultured from irradiated seeds were found to be dose- and quality-dependent, suggesting that heavier ions cause more severe damage (<xref rid="life-12-00144-f007" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref>).

Space Mission Relevant Experiments</title><p>In actual deep space radiation scenarios, GCR presents a constant extremely low dose rate background radiation field. Because seed imbibition occurs over a relatively short interval (hours to days depending on seed types), maximum cumulative GCR dose during imbibition is expected to be at the milligray range for a 10-day exposure. Therefore, protons released from a large SPE, typically delivered within a couple of days, pose a more significant impact for imbibed seeds than GCR exposure. On the other hand, dry seeds in long-term storage during deep space missions would be exposed to a much higher accumulative GCR dose, which may affect seed viability over long-duration missions. Therefore, we evaluated GCR impact on dry seeds of <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> and Mizuna, and SPE effect on imbibed seeds.</p><p>For dry <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds, the GCR-2 scenario did not cause significant changes in germination, viability, or morphology. Root length was impacted more in imbibed seeds by exposure to GCR1 (59 cGy) than in dry seeds by exposure to GCR2 (80 cGy), indicating hydrated seeds are more sensitive to radiation damage as expected. Furthermore, radiation quality plays an important role because 250 MeV/n proton (40 cGy) showed more significant impact on hydrated <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds than simulated SPE (40 cGy) with spectra ranging from 50 to 150 MeV/n, even though both radiation scenarios cause shortened root length.

This difference between species highlights the need to identify and focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions, as outcomes from model organisms are not universal and may not be applicable. Increased cotyledon deformation was not significant following LDR, indicating potential activation of DNA repair mechanisms. Further evaluation of various crops may help to identify those most resistant to DNA damage and enable identification and screening for the most efficient repair mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-life-12-00144"><title>4.3.

There have been several long-duration exposures of seeds to the space environment using different platforms such as the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) facility, the EXPOSE facility, and the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). MISSE and EXPOSE are multi-user facilities designed to operate outside of the ISS. The LDEF was deployed to low-Earth orbit (LEO) at approximately 250 nautical miles in 1984 and had orbited the Earth for about 5.7 years. It was retrieved in 1990 at about 178 nautical miles. At present, MISSE and EXPOSE are still operational. The reports of these studies are not quite consistent. In a 27-month EXPOSE-R experiment stationed outside the ISS, analysis of the germination results revealed that the tomato seeds did not survive the exposure to radiation with or without UV. <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds survived only in a dark layer shielded from UV exposure and were able to germinate and further develop [<xref rid="B43-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In another report from Tepfer et al.

In contrast, under a different space environmental condition in the LDEF flight, tomato seeds maintained at a controlled climate of 14 psi with 15% humidity at an altitude between 175 to 275 nautical miles only showed that the pores of the strophiole region of the flight seeds were larger in size than those in the ground control seeds, which might affect germination [<xref rid="B12-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>For other space radiation related research platforms, in a very recent experiment using the Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system, a 1U CubeSat design, <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> seeds (under 1 atm) were exposed to the stratosphere (36&#8211;40 km) environment above Antarctica in a 30-day, long-duration high altitude balloon mission [<xref rid="B45-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In a parallel experiment, dry seeds were exposed to a 40 cGy GCR1 simulation at NSRL. GCR and stratosphere exposed seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates of 76.4% and 82.5%, respectively compared to 98% for the controls. Significantly elevated somatic mutation rates (and developmental aberrations) were also revealed in these GCR or stratosphere exposed seeds with the GCR exposure generating significantly higher mutation rates than that of Antarctica. These mutations also resulted in the death or delayed growth of certain plant organs. Heritable mutations were found in the second generation of the GCR irradiated seeds [<xref rid="B45-life-12-00144" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

We observed dependence of outcome measures on dose, dose rate, and radiation quality, with heavier ions causing more severe damage. Exposures to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had much less effect compared to exposures to heavier and higher LET particles, but there were significant impacts that appear to be dependent on the seed type. As expected, hydrated seeds were more sensitive to radiation exposure than were dry seeds.</p><p>Complementary to the results we presented here, it is very important to understand the cellular and molecular basis of these findings. Numerous parameters can be evaluated in future studies to provide deeper insights in the mechanisms behind these reported findings, from analyzing relative sizes and cellular organization of the apical meristem and elongation zone, to conducting multi-omics analyses. Plant DNA damage response and repair mechanisms in response to space radiation also need to be fully characterized. To this end, we are currently conducting an RNAseq analysis using the harvested seedling samples from this study. In addition, we are in the process of evaluating the degree to which GCR and SPE radiation exposures affect the ability of seeds of mizuna, lettuce, and tomato to develop into adult plants and edible fresh produce. </p><p>In space, plant seeds are exposed to multiple space environmental factors, such as altered gravity, suboptimal growth conditions including water stress, high CO<sub>2</sub> and environmental volatile organic compound (VOC) levels, ethylene generation, and altered air pressure that may cause stress and impact plant growth. Furthermore, plants developed from sanitized seeds may be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens from the unique microbiome of a transit vehicle. The space radiation environment may further impair the ability of seeds and plants to adapt to these environmental challenges during long-duration missions. In order to support successful integration of fresh food production systems in future spaceflight missions, more studies need to be conducted to understand radiation impacts on a wider variety of space crop candidates and other developmental stages in the plant life cycle, such as young seedling growth, embryogenesis, and seed maturation. More studies are also needed to identify physical or biological methods that efficiently protect or repair seeds from deep space radiation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We appreciate all the support from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Lab.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Publisher&#8217;s Note:</bold> MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, Y.Z.; methodology, Y.Z., J.T.R. and M.H.
