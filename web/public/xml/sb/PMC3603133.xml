The goal of this study was to investigate the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading on ECs phenotype as determined by patterns of gene expression. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 1-gravity environment or mechanical unloading (MU) for 24&#8197;hours, with or without periods of mechanical loading (ML). MU led to a significant decrease in gene expression of several adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines. On the contrary, eNOS, Caveolin-1 and -2 expression were significantly increased with MU. There was a decrease in the length and width of the cells with MU. Addition of ML during the MU period was sufficient to reverse the changes triggered by MU. Our results suggest that gravitational loading could dramatically affect vascular endothelial cell function.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Alterations in endothelial function has been involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases on Earth through angiogenesis, vascular remodeling and atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Changes in endothelial hemostasis have also been associated with post-spaceflight orthostatic intolerance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Hence understanding functioning of the vascular endothelium becomes critical for different diseases pathogenesis. The healthy endothelium maintains a critical relationship with the outside environment through the blood and hemodynamic forces. This relationship is governed by a well-studied frictional force: shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Regulation of vascular endothelial cells (ECs) responses to shear stress involve a complex cascades of gene responses with different temporal profiles and shear stress impacts ECs morphology, function and gene expression, the latter taking place transcriptionally and/or post-trancriptionally<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. In fact, DNA microarray analysis has demonstrated that 3% of all genes responded to shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. If ECs express 20,000&#8197;genes, then approximately 600 would be responsive to shear stress.</p><p>The cytoskeleton is at the center of the ECs responses to shear stress. The cells respond to rapid laminar flow by becoming spindle-shaped and aligned with their long axis parallel to the direction of blood flow<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. This is accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. When flow is turbulent or stagnant, the cells become rounder in shape and do not have a uniform orientation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Hence, the cytoskeleton is critical in sensing mechanical forces, with a change in their morphology leading to changes in inflammation and atherogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>Although shear stress has been studied extensively, mechanotransduction, that is the mechanisms by which cells convert mechanical stimulus into chemical activity are not fully understood. It is thought that &#8220;sensing&#8221; of mechanical forces and shear stress signal transduction through the cytoskeleton take place, at least partially through caveolae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The caveolae are membrane microdomains measuring approximately 50&#8211;10&#8197;nm in length that are visible as flask-shaped invaginations below the surface of cells, containing many signaling molecules<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In response to increased flow, calcium gradients develop close to caveolae and propagate through the entire cell in the form of a calcium wave<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. The calcium increase close to caveolae causes the caveolae to rapidly liberate the nitric oxide (NO) synthase eNOS into the cytoplasm, where it catalyzes the production of NO. Caveolins have also been reported to be involved in the early phases of atherosclerosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> with absence of caveolin-1 in mice characterized by impaired blood-flow-dependent vascular remodeling and vasodilator responses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>In-vitro techniques used to study mechanotransduction have included fluid flow (sheer stress), four-point bending, substrate stretch, as well as gravity force, vibration, magnetic fields, atomic forces and shockwaves<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. The effects of gravitational forces on mechanotransduction in ECs responses have been the matter of only a few investigations and remain largely unknown. It is well known that astronauts experience cardiovascular deconditioning during spaceflight manifested among others as orthostatic intolerance, and some investigators have suggested that the nitric oxide system is involved in these changes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. At the physiological level, we demonstrated changes in the cardiovascular system with simulated microgravity characterized by alterations in sympathetic function, the renin-angiotensin system and electrolyte excretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Overall, understanding the effects of gravitational mechanical forces is important as mechanical unloading (MU) of cells has been shown to alter cell cytoskeleton<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, affect caveolae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> and eNOS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. If shear stress can affect the cytoskeleton, cell function and expression, can gravitational mechanical forces do the same? Since caveolins are gravity-sensing elements and eNOS is tightly related to inflammation and cell-cell interaction including adhesion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, could microgravity have the potential to alter processes such as inflammation and cell-to-cell interaction?</p><p>In this report, we investigate the effects of gravitational MU on primary ECs. The goals are to assess whether cell morphology is involved in functions such as eNOS regulation, inflammation and adhesion. To assess this, primary vascular endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cells- HUVECs) were placed under MU and mechanical loading (ML) conditions after which gene expression profiles and the cytoskeleton were studied. We hypothesized that MU would lead to changes in the morphology of the cells and their gene expression, which could be reversed by ML.</p><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effects of mechanical unloading on adhesion molecules and inflammation</title><p>To assess if exposure of endothelial cells to simulated MU has a significant impact on expression of adhesion molecules or inflammatory and angiogenic factors, we used quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometry to measure the levels of gene expression and presence at the cell surface respectively.

This response remained similar after 48&#8197;hours of exposure to MU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Compare to MU alone, the addition of L-NAME to MU led to a decrease in eNOS and Cav-1 (although not a complete return to the levels seen with control) and an increase in Cav-2.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mechanical loading reverses the changes mediated by mechanical unloading in endothelial cells</title><p>To further investigate the causes of the molecular changes triggered by MU, we studied the effect of short reloading periods by applying mechanical loading (ML) to the ECs during the period of MU. Strikingly, three short periods of ML during 24&#8197;hours of MU were sufficient to completely reverse the changes seen in adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators, eNOS and caveolins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cytoskeletal changes associated with MU</title><p>MU significantly affected the morphology of HUVECs.

The exact localization of Cav-1 under MU and a direct link with the increase of eNOS activity need to be established. However, the disruption of the actin cytoskeletal organization by MU could impair the translocation of Cav-1 to the caveolae, and together with the increase of eNOS expression, could contribute to the increase of NOS activity.

We also demonstrated reversal of the morphology and gene expression towards baseline with three short periods of mechanical loading. Since alterations in gene expression were accompanied by changes in the cytoskeleton and both cell morphology and gene expression returned to baseline with the addition of hypergravity, our findings suggest that ECs gene expression and cytoarchitecture are tightly linked to gravitational mechanical forces, with a possible role for the caveolins<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p><p>The present study demonstrates that microgravity alters the cytoskeleton of ECs. It appears that the actin filaments become disorganized and redistributed within the cells, with as a possible consequence an inability to transport molecules to the outside of the cells, such as the caveolins to the caveolae at the plasma membrane. Cells are known to stabilize their structure and shape by means of interconnected network of cytoskeletal components including microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments. <italic toggle="yes">In vitro</italic>, when subjected to shear stress in a flow-loading device, net cellular movement happens orienting them in the direction of the shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, a phenomenon accompanied by cytoskeletal reorganization with actin filaments rearranged into bundles of stress fibers and aligned in the direction of the shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>.</p><p>In microgravity, cytoarchitectural alterations of different endothelial cell lines have been reported to occur. Buravkova et al demonstrated changes in the cytoskeleton of HUVECs within 1&#8211;2&#8197;hours of simulated microgravity with actin filament thinning and their redistribution to cell borders (with the central area becoming practically free of actin fibers while there was formation of continuous F-actin band at the intercellular contact area)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. Siamwala demonstrated that 2&#8197;hours of simulated microgravity in EAhy926 ECs lead to actin rearrangements and increase in nitric oxide production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Versari et al also showed that HUVECs in microgravity for 96&#8197;hours had disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and a decrease in the total amount of actin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Infanger et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity had altered cytoskeletal components and the formation of cell aggregates in the monolayer after 12&#8197;hours. Carlsson et al also demonstrated disorganization of the actin fibers with clustering of the fibers around the nucleus up to 96&#8197;hr in simulated microgravity, then disappearing after 144&#8197;hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Grimm et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> showed that EA.hy926 cells in microgravity formed tubular structures that actually had an increased amount of actin that covered the entire surface of the tubular structure.</p><p>It appears that expression and localization of key integrins that mediate EC attachment and spreading, such as the vitronectin and fibronectin receptors, could likely be involved in the changes seen in the cytoskeleton. For example, integrins have been shown to be decreased during parabolic flight in HUVECs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. The expression of fibronectin has been found to be increased with simulated microgravity in EA.hy.926<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. Tube-shaped structures of EA.hy.926 forming after 2&#8197;weeks of simulated microgravity produced more fibronectin. Although not demonstrated in endothelial cells to our knowledge, Rho GAP expression has been found to be increased two fold with spaceflight in rat osteoblasts, suggesting that microgravity suppress Rho signals regulating actin filament rearrangement<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. Since the cytoskeleton plays an important role in shear-stress-induced NO production and ICAM-1 gene expression by ECs with shear stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, it could then be expected that MU also alters expression of eNOS, inflammatory and adhesion molecules.</p><p>We demonstrated in this study a decrease in IL-6 and TNF-&#945; expression with MU, which was reversed by hypergravity. This was coupled with a decrease in adhesion molecules ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, also reversed with hypergravity. Investigators have reported different effects of mechanical unloading or microgravity in the literature. For example, IL-6 was found to be increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, decreased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, and unchanged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> in separate studies, which may be related to different conditions. IL-8 was also found to be increased<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> and unchanged<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> in separate studies. Buravkova et al found that 12-24&#8197;hours of simulated microgravity increased ICAM-1 in HUVECs but not VCAM-1 or E-Selectin- in fact microgravity had opposite effects on ICAM-1 compared to VCAM-1 and E-Selectin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we found that mechanical unloading led to an increase in Caveolin-1 and -2 gene expression. This correlated with an increase in eNOS expression and nitrite concentration. Our results are overall consistent with the forming body of knowledge on the effects of simulated microgravity on endothelial cells. For example, Spisni et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> found that caveolin-1 protein expression was increased with 24&#8197;hours of microgravity. With regards to NO production, two studies showed an increase in eNOS protein levels and increased NO production at 48&#8197;hours and 72&#8197;hours respectively<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. However, Spisni et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> found no change in eNOS or iNOS protein levels yet an increase in NO production at 24&#8197;hours. Ulbrich et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> actually found decreased eNOS gene expression at 24&#8197;hours. Finally, Wang et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> found increased iNOS protein levels at 24&#8197;hours. Recently, Shi et al reported that HUVECs exposed to 24&#8197;hours of simulated microgravity using a 2-D clinostat had an enhanced eNOS activity and promoted angiogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>.</p><p>It is likely that the changes seen in inflammation, adhesion molecules expression, eNOS and caveolins are mediated through a change in the cytoskeleton since the cytoskeleton is altered by MU and returns toward baseline with ML, along with gene expression. This study has important implications for spaceflight. It is well known that astronauts suffer from orthostatic intolerance (OI) upon returning to a gravity environment after spaceflight. It has been suggested that the nitric oxide system may be involved<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Our findings support a role of increased NO production in the pathophysiology of post-spaceflight OI but more importantly, suggest that this variable may be improved by the addition of artificial gravity since 3&#8197;periods of 30&#8197;minutes of hypergravity in this study reversed the changes seen in microgravity.</p><p>In addition to the implications of our findings to OI, it is interesting to note that the changes seen would be considered &#8220;anti-inflammatory&#8221; and possibly protective for early atherogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). This opens the way to explore new therapies to treat cardiovascular diseases by manipulation of cell phenotype using gravitational forces. Although the significance of the findings with regards to an overall &#8220;dysregulation&#8221; of the cells compared to a true change towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype need to be further assessed, our findings would suggest that microgravity may have a beneficial impact on the health of blood vessels. It has been of important interest to know that astronauts are more at risk of immune dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. The changes in the vascular ECs could therefore be involved in the overall changes in the immune system seen with spaceflight. Our findings support the fact that the cells respond to altered gravitational environments, which could have an important impact on organ physiology.</p><p>In summary, gravitational mechanical unloading affects inflammatory and adhesion molecules expression in ECs towards an &#8220;anti-inflammatory&#8221; phenotype. This is coupled with an increase in eNOS and caveolin gene expression. In view of the changes seen in the cytoskeleton and the reversal of both gene expression and morphology with exposure to ML, it is highly likely that this &#8220;anti-inflammatory&#8221; phenotype is mediated through changes in the cytoskeleton. Our findings further support a role for caveolae as gravity-sensing elements and demonstrate plasticity of changes with gravitational mechanical forces.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human Umbilical Vascular Endothelial Cells (HUVECs; HUVECs Clonetics, Lonza) were cultured at 37&#176;C/5% CO<sub>2</sub> in EBM&#174;-2 Endothelial Cell Basal Medium-2 supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.2% (v/v) Gentamicin Sulfate and Amphotericin-B, 0.2% (v/v) Heparin, 0.2% (v/v) Hydrocortison, 0.2% (v/v) rhVEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rhEGF, 0.2% (v/v) rIGF1 and 0.4% (v/v) rhFGF-&#946; (Lonza, Walkersville, MD USA).

A desktop RPM described by Huijser<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> and manufactured by Fokker Space was used to provide mechanical unloading. The RPM is 30 &#215; 30 &#215; 30&#8197;cm that was placed into an incubator at 37&#176;C. The RPM has inner and outer frames that are independently controlled by two different motors and is operated in random modes of speed and direction (0.1&#8211;2&#8197;rad/s) via a computer user interface with dedicated control. The cell culture flasks were mounted on the center of the platform located on the inner frame. Under this experimental condition, the cells were exposed to mechanical unloading conditions ranging from 0.02 and 0.05&#8197;g. For static 1-g controls, cell culture flasks seeded at the same time as the mechanically unloaded flasks were placed into the same incubator as the RPM samples.</p><p>A cellular g-loading apparatus was used for mechanical hyperloading as already described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>.

The animals were hung no more than 30&#8197;degrees (as calculated by the angle of spine of animal to the floor with forelimbs extended) to minimize discomfort. Eight control animals were kept in identical cages to the experimental animals but without hind limbs suspension.
