One such concern is muscle atrophy, which is partly attributed to the dysregulation of calcium levels due to abnormalities in SERCA pump functioning. To identify potential biomarkers for this condition, multi-omics data and physiological data available on the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov) were used, and machine learning methods were employed. Specifically, we used multi-omics (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) data and calcium reuptake data collected from C57BL/6&#8201;J mouse soleus and tibialis anterior tissues during several 30+ day-long missions on the international space station. The QLattice symbolic regression algorithm was introduced to generate highly explainable models that predict either experimental conditions or calcium reuptake levels based on multi-omics features. The list of candidate models established by QLattice was used to identify key features contributing to the predictive capability of these models, with Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins found to be the most predictive biomarkers related to the resilience of the tibialis anterior muscle in space. These findings could serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Molecular biology</kwd><kwd>Mathematics and computing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Muscle atrophy, caused by prolonged exposure to microgravity conditions, is a major challenge faced by astronauts during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although intense physical exercise is currently the main countermeasure, it requires a significant amount of time from each astronaut (2.5&#8201;hours per day, including equipment setup and breakdown), and even with exercise, the continuous exposure to microgravity cannot be fully offset.</p><p id="Par3">It has been proposed that muscle atrophy may be at least partly explained by the dysregulation of cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels due to abnormalities in the Sarco Endoplasmic Reticulum Calcium ATPase (SERCA) pump&#8217;s ability to reuptake cytoplasmic Ca<sup>2+</sup> during muscle relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Mammalian muscles are broadly classified into two types: slow-twitch muscles composed predominantly of oxidative muscle fibers (e.g., postural muscles like the soleus [SOL], which is found in the calf and is important for resisting the pull of gravity) and fast-twitch muscles composed predominantly of glycolytic muscle fibers (e.g., explosive muscles like the tibialis anterior [TA], located in the shin). The SOL and TA are two of the primary muscles impacted by spaceflight, and previous studies have shown that both the murine SOL and TA will atrophy in response to microgravity exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">With respect to Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling, recent work has shown that during spaceflight, Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is impaired in the SOL muscle while being enhanced in the TA muscle, indicating that SERCA function is affected differently in the two muscle types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, the molecular mechanisms driving these aberrations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake by SERCA are not very well elucidated. Additionally, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling at the level of SERCA was not impaired in the TA, it is possible that there may be other molecular drivers of the muscle atrophy phenotype. Understanding these mechanisms at the molecular level is important for prevention and mitigation.</p><p id="Par5">Machine learning (ML) methods are particularly effective in identifying patterns in complex biological data, particularly for discovering biomarkers in heterogeneous, high-dimensional, multi-omics datasets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Compared to traditional statistical methods, ML methods are also less prone to distribution-specific effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, making them a promising alternative to classic systems biology. This is particularly important for space biological research, where small datasets are often combined to increase statistical power.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we present an ML-based approach to create a mapping between changes in multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic) and calcium reuptake in the SOL and TA muscles of mice that have been flown in space, compared to ground controls. To our knowledge, this approach has not been applied to this scientific question before.</p><p id="Par7">When choosing an ML method for the purposes of gaining insight into biomedical research, it is important to consider two criteria: explainability/interpretability and generalizability. Many conventional state-of-the-art algorithms, such as neural networks, are seen as &#8220;black boxes&#8221; due to the low interpretability of the values and interactions of intermediate neurons deep within the network. Such algorithms thus have low explainability and are not ideal for research, where the ultimate goal is not performance but rather acquiring a more sophisticated understanding of relationships between variables. Furthermore, a major challenge posed by multi-omics data, in particular, is the lack of generalizability of learned models due to the heterogeneity, high-dimensionality, and low-sample-size (HDLSS) nature of the data. Highly expressive algorithms like neural networks will generate severely overfit models when trained on HDLSS data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">With these criteria in mind, we chose to use a recently developed implementation of symbolic regression called QLattice, developed by Abzu ApS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Symbolic regression attempts to find the true, concise mathematical function directly underlying the features&#8217; relationship to the target, which is much more interpretable than neural network architectures and less likely to overfit. It does this by representing mathematical expressions as computational graphs, where the nodes represent variables or functions, and by exploring the possible architectures for these computational graphs. QLattice explores this graph space efficiently to find concise, interpretable, and accurate models, which make it a suitable tool for biomarker discovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">We aimed to identify molecular drivers of spaceflight effects on muscle physiology using spaceflight mouse muscle data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR) with omics data found in GeneLab<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> reuptake data found in Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. First, we trained QLattice to predict calcium reuptake levels of spaceflight and ground control mice using multi-omics features (genes, proteins, etc.), a regression task. Second, we trained QLattice to predict whether samples were from spaceflight or ground control mice, a classification task. We then identified features that contributed most to the predictive capabilities of the model&#8217;s output by QLattice; these features (i.e., genes, proteins, or epigenetic markers) are potential biomarkers that may provide mechanistic insight behind the spaceflight-induced muscle physiology effects and serve as targets for future interventions aiming to reduce the extent of muscle atrophy during space travel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Multi-omics biomarkers associated with spaceflight calcium reuptake aberrations are revealed by machine learning regression analysis</title><p id="Par10">Exposure to spaceflight has been previously reported to increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in mouse TA muscles and decrease Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in mouse SOL muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. We hypothesized that this phenotypic change can be further understood by examining the relationships between genes, proteins, and methylation markers. Therefore, we trained QLattice to identify multi-omics biomarkers predictive of changes in calcium reuptake capacity, using multi-omics datasets from OSD-104 mouse SOL muscle and OSD-105 mouse TA muscle from female C57BL/6J mice flown at 16 weeks of age on the RR-1 mission. For each muscle type, multi-omics data were combined and subject to dimensionality reduction prior to QLattice training, and calcium reuptake levels were used as a target (see Methods and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). We matched RR-1 SOL multi-omics data with RR-1 SOL calcium data and RR-1 TA multi-omics data with RR-9 TA calcium data. In the latter case, note that RR-9 includes 10-week male mice while RR-1 includes 16-week female mice, but we hypothesized that the spaceflight muscle effect would be great enough to overcome these differences.

We excluded the methylation data because including it reduced QLattice performance while producing very similar results (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref>). The top two features predictive of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake rate were Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Representative models containing Acyp1 and Rps7 are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. These models consisted of bivariate Gaussian functions, bivariate multiply functions, and univariate tanh functions (see <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">Supplementary Information</xref> for additional discussion of model architectures). Of the 27 models containing Rps7, 24 included a relationship with Acyp1, possibly indicating a biological interaction between the two features that could be tested in the future through laboratory studies.

Instead of using the traditional systems biology approach, ML methods provide unbiased identification of potential candidates for biological mechanisms.

Calcium reuptake is reportedly improved in TA muscle but impaired in SOL muscle, during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, with limited understanding of the molecular signaling causing these phenotypic changes. Here, we report that enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in FLT TA is directly related to the combined interaction of Acyp1 protein downregulation and Rps7 protein upregulation; while decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in FLT SOL is related to interactions of upregulation of several different pairs of genes, including <italic toggle="yes">Gpc4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Tle4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Rspo3</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Klhl31</italic>.

We noted a variety of mathematical functions in the QLattice models from our analysis, including bivariate Gaussian, bivariate multiply, univariate tanh, addition, multiplication, and log. The response plots provided by QLattice help translate the mathematical functions into biological and mechanistic interpretations (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). We noted that when Gaussian functions are reported, only the first half of the Gaussian curve is being used to fit a sigmoidal trend (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Biologically, we interpret this to be because biological quantities (e.g., calcium concentration) cannot be negative, nor cannot exceed a certain threshold (e.g., the total amount of calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum). Thus, linear models would actually fail to extrapolate in these more extreme ends of the quantity&#8217;s range, while sigmoidal models would fit much more accurately. To further improve the predictive capability of this tool, it would be valuable to further characterize the relationship between the mathematical functions identified by QLattice and the distribution of protein concentrations in various tissues. Such characteristics would help further translate the interactions of the various functions found in QLattice with an actual biological process between different key components of a tissue.</p><p id="Par29">While additional study is needed to fully characterize the relationships identified here by QLattice, we suggest that QLattice&#8217;s emphasis on concise, interpretable models makes it an especially appropriate ML methodology for research applications where explainability is key. Biomedical research, and especially space biology research, presents the additional challenge of small sample sizes, which usually leads to severe overfitting and a lack of generalizability in the models found by conventional ML algorithms. This issue is at least partially addressed by QLattice&#8217;s predisposition to limit the architectural complexity of models (which has a strong regularizing effect), as well as its heavy intrinsic feature selection based on mutual information with the target variable. A valuable future study would be to characterize the relationship between the individual data modalities and the overall multi-omics results.</p><p id="Par30">As demonstrated in this study, when an ML method properly accounts for these challenges and priorities specific to space biology research, it can provide significant guidance for what to focus on in future research. Although the top biomarkers from QLattice must be further characterized and confirmed, the method has appreciably narrowed the research &#8220;search space&#8221; by directing us toward groups of biomarkers that are most promising. In this way, explainable and interpretable ML, with its advantage over humans in being able to process huge feature spaces, serves as a metaphorical &#8220;metal detector,&#8221; telling us where we should start digging. The results we report here would benefit from future experimental validation studies.</p><p id="Par31">We conclude with our observations on the contributions of the different types of omics data to the QLattice predictive models. In this work, DNA methylation CpG+ features, when mapped to gene names or when maintained as genomic coordinates, failed to greatly contribute to model architectures and resulted in lower predictive performance. We suggest that this may be because methylation marks are deposited over time, so molecular changes during spaceflight are primarily dominated by functional changes, while small but persistent epigenetic changes may be better captured upon return to earth. To test this hypothesis, future studies could capture methylation measurements both before and after spaceflight from the same animals. In accordance with this hypothesis, both protein and gene expression changes were the most predictive features, with the top proteomic features much stronger and more cohesive than those of top RNA-seq features. This may constitute support in favor of focusing on proteomic analysis over RNA-seq analysis in future spaceflight studies, as the relationship between proteins and function is more immediate compared to the presumably noisier relationship between transcripts and function.</p><p id="Par32">Taken together, our results build on previous work in the field by reporting a promising demonstration of an explainable ML method for space biology research and providing several potential biomarkers for future study on muscle response to spaceflight.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>RNA sequencing data (RR-1&#8212;SOL and TA muscles&#8212;female)</title><p id="Par33">For RNA-seq RR-1 data, we started with the raw count files available on OSDR from the GeneLab RNA-seq processing pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

The number of epochs corresponded to the number of generations for the evolutionary search algorithm as a whole rather than the number of epochs of backpropagation for any individual model architecture being explored. We tried various values for the number of epochs between 10 and 100, but there were no significant differences in validation performance or feature rankings. The maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 4 (2 features and 2 functional interactions) for the SOL analysis since SOL data had two data types, and we were interested in modeling the interactions between the data types. Similarly, the maximum architectural complexity was restricted to 6 for the TA analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par39">Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using the Enrichr implementation in the <italic toggle="yes">gseapy</italic> library (v0.10.4) in Python, using GO_Biological_Process_2021 as the background gene set.
