CDR3 is partially responsible for Ab&#8211;Ag binding and is a significant source of diversity in the repertoire. CDR3 diversity is generated during VDJ rearrangement because of gene segment selection, gene segment trimming and splicing, and the addition of nucleotides. We analyzed the Ab repertoire diversity across multiple experiments examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire after vaccination. Five datasets from four experiments were analyzed using rank-abundance curves and Shannon indices as measures of diversity. We discovered a trend toward lower diversity as a result of spaceflight but did not find the same decrease in our physiological model of microgravity in either the spleen or bone marrow. However, the bone marrow repertoire showed a reduction in diversity after vaccination. We also detected differences in Shannon indices between experiments and tissues. We did not detect a pattern of CDR3 usage across the experiments. Overall, we were able to find differences in the Ab repertoire diversity across experimental groups and tissues.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Abs are heterodimers composed of H and L chains (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The rearrangements of three different gene segments, the variable (V) gene segment, the diversity (D) gene segment (H chain only), and the joining (J) gene segment forms the variable regions of the Ab (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p id="P3">Abs play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response, protecting the host from a variety of challenges. The collection of Abs within a host, known as the Ab repertoire, must be highly diverse to bind a wide variety of Ags (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). CDR3 contributes the most to both the Ab repertoire diversity and binding specificity in the Ab repertoire (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). CDR3 is composed of the 3&#8217; region of the V-gene segment, the D-gene segment (H chain only), and the J-gene segment. The process of organizing these gene segments into a functional unit is called VDJ rearrangement.</p><p id="P4">Our group studies the effects of space on the host response, with a focus on the Ab repertoire. We have shown that spaceflight alone (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) does not affect the overall Ab repertoire and that a physiological model of microgravity, antiorthostatic suspension (AOS), affects the Ab repertoire after vaccination in both the spleen and bone marrow (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Other works have shown that changes to V-gene segment usage in <italic toggle="yes">Pleurodeles waltl</italic> after five months aboard the International Space Station (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p id="P5">Diversity, or the lack thereof, in the Ab repertoire can be generated through multiple steps in VDJ rearrangement. Research shows that there is genetic control over the high-level usage of specific gene segments, but individual CDR3 repertoires are highly variable (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Previous work shows that variations in recombination signal sequences, which are the sequences beside the gene segment that regulate recombination, may lead to differential usage of a specific gene segment in the repertoire (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Additionally, locations of gene segments on the genome also play a role in gene segment selection in humans with more 3&#8217; D-gene segments pairing more commonly with more 5&#8217; J-gene segments and more 5&#8217; D-gene segments pairing with more 3&#8217; J-gene segments (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). After the gene segments are spliced, additional nucleotides, called N or P nucleotides, are added at the junction between gene segments. P nucleotides are palindromic and complete the overhangs made during exonuclease cuts in the genome (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). N nucleotides are random nucleotides added by TdT (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the mouse repertoire, P nucleotides are more common than N nucleotides and help drive diversity (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p id="P6">An immune response to an Ag (pathogen) is an adaptation. Likewise, responding to changes in gravitational forces also requires adaptation. Our group has had the opportunity to examine the Ab repertories in C57BL/6 mice after a number of different situations. These data allowed us a unique opportunity to test the hypothesis that Ab diversity can be altered by physiological adaptation. That is, spaceflight, simulated spaceflight, and/or immune responses are disruptions in stable environment and affect Ab diversity. To test this hypothesis, we will present an analysis of Ab diversity, as expressed by CDR3 amino acids, in four experiments and five datasets we have generated using analyses frequently used to assess communities in ecological contexts, specifically the Shannon index (SI), an established measure of diversity (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The higher the SI, the more diversity the community. Immunologically, repertoire diversity is essential to maintain a healthy adaptive immune system. Theoretically, if an individual has a diverse Ab repertoire, there are more possibilities of productive responses to more Ags. Therefore, diversity measurements of the Ab repertoire are relevant to understanding host fitness (as defined immunologically and ecologically). For example, work by Greiff et al. (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) has shown that diversity measures can determine if an animal was vaccinated or unvaccinated.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p id="P7">Five different datasets from four experiments were used in the analyses presented in this article (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Tables I</xref>, <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">II</xref>).

Statistical methods commonly used in the ecology field have been used by other groups to assess Ab repertoires, although often with a larger scale view (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Some have been able to determine immunological status by examining diversity (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p id="P29">Estimated hypothetical total diversity is estimated to be ~1 &#215; 10<sup>140</sup> total unique CDR3 sequences (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, the functional diversity is much more highly restricted to around 1 &#215; 10<sup>13</sup> to ~1 &#215; 10<sup>18</sup> because of the V-, D-, and J-gene segments that create the CDR3 backbone (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and because mice only have ~1 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> B cells, many of the potential CDR3s are never seen in the repertoire (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Saada et al. (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) estimated that whereas 35 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> large pre&#8211;B cells enter mitosis each day, only around 3 &#215; 10<sup>6</sup> B cells survive selection. Our study examines a total of 1,173,166 unique Ab sequences arising from 44 individual and 18 pooled animals across four experiments.</p><p id="P30">In our unamplified individual mouse spleen samplings, there is an average of ~3000 unique CDR3s that are not found in any other mouse. This might translate to ~30,000 unique CDR3s if we assume we are assessing 10% of the repertoire or 300,000 unique CDR3s if that amplification is only 1% of the repertoire compared with what we might see if we amplified the sequencing. Given that mice have 1 &#215; 10<sup>8</sup> total B cells, unique B cells account for ~0.3&#8211;0.03% of the repertoire, based on CDR3 capture. Our results contrast other estimations (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) of shared naive B cells at 11&#8211;13%. Therefore, our data suggest that there is more sharing of repertoires than previously estimated.</p><p id="P31">We have established a baseline SI for the spleen between 7.28 and 7.68. However, it is essential to remember that these numbers were generated from pooled samples in an effort to normalize the reading. Our previous work showed that the pooled normal mouse V-gene segment usage was similar between pools (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.5842&#8211;0.8427), but CDR3 sequences showed an overlap of only 75 CDR3s found in all three groups (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We also detected a pattern in the rank-abundance curves for each pool. One predominant CDR3 comprised the highest rank, and abundance quickly dropped as rank increased, demonstrating that the population was highly skewed. The highest CDR3 in each pool was unique with CARGAYW, CASVYDG-YAFAYW, and CASYDFDYW for pools 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p><p id="P32">We also explored the effects of spaceflight alone on diversity in the Ab repertoire. Although T cell repertoires have been examined during spaceflight (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), little research exists examining the effects of spaceflight on the Ab repertoire. We found no statistical difference between SIs for ground and flight animals, but a trend (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.1138) toward lower diversity in the flight animals was detected. The animals used in this experiment were older (35 wk at flight), and a different strain (C57BL/6Tac) than used in the other experiments that were analyzed in this paper. Additionally, the flight was relatively short, with only 3 wk in microgravity. Age is known to affect the Ab repertoire by reducing diversity (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) and other works have shown that aged humans respond poorly to vaccinations (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Aging decreases B and T cell regeneration rates (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Because the half-life of a B cell in the spleen is between 4 and 7 wk (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), a longer flight time may strengthen the lower diversity trend we noticed. The sample size was also small because these data were obtained as a secondary science objective from an initial validation flight (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) and a larger sample size may provide more information regarding this trend.</p><p id="P33">The CASIS and TARDIS spleen datasets provided us a unique situation to directly compare spaceflight data to the AOS model of microgravity using the same bioinformatics methodology. Although the sequencing and bioinformatics methodology was the same, the mouse strain (C57BL/6Tac, CASIS flight; C57BL/6J, TARDIS model), age (35 wk, flight; 9 wk, model), tissue preservation (RNAlater, flight; snap frozen, model), and RNA extraction (RNeasy, flight; TRIzol, model) were all different. These differences mean that a direct comparison is less than ideal, but given the relative scarcity of data from flight animals, the comparison is nonetheless valuable. We found that the control animals (CASIS ground and TARDIS loaded) and experimental animals (CASIS flight and TARDIS unloaded) were not statistically different. However, when the complete CASIS dataset was compared with the complete TARDIS dataset, we found that the CASIS animals had significantly lower SIs. Although our total read counts were similar between the two experiments (CASIS, 66,909&#8211;181,703; TARDIS average, 82,655&#8211;109,107) (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), the low number of samples in the CASIS dataset (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 6) compared with the TARDIS dataset (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 32) is more likely to be skewed by a single low diversity mouse. Additionally, the increased age of the CASIS mice and may also contribute to their overall lower SIs, as mentioned above.</p><p id="P34">In our TARDIS dataset, we explored the effects of AOS, TT, and CpG1826 treatment on the spleen and bone marrow. In the spleen we found no differences in SIs among treatment groups. This included no impact on diversity in TT&#8722; or TT + CpG1826-treated mice. However, there was a trend for a higher abundance of the rank one splenic CDR3 in TT-treated animals (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> = 0.0571). In the bone marrow, only TT-treated animals showed a reduced diversity SIs. Unloading again did not affect TT&#8722; or TT + CpG1826&#8211;treated animals. Both the higher abundance rank one CDR3s and the lower diversity are indicative of the TT-specific response. As the repertoire narrows to focus on responding to the Ag, the total number of unique CDR3s is likely to decrease, decreasing overall diversity. Greiff et al. (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have also demonstrated that the Ag-specific response is higher in plasma cells in the bone marrow than the spleen.</p><p id="P35">We were also able to compare CDR3 usage in the spleen directly to the bone marrow of the same animals in our TARDIS dataset. We found that the bone marrow had lower diversity than the spleen for all animals. This could be because the populations of cells in the bone marrow are less diverse because they are memory populations waiting to respond to agonists (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Splenic and circulating B cells may be more diverse because they are less experienced. Alternatively, previous studies have shown that V-gene segment usage by naive B cells in the spleen and pre&#8211;B cells in the bone marrow are strongly influenced by the genetic background of the animal, whereas the plasma cells are a mostly individual variation (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Our workflow does not allow us to identify the cells that make up our population. However, this individual variation may not explain the consistent lower SIs in the bone marrow samples of all 18 of the mice examined.</p><p id="P36">To assess the anti-TT&#8211;specific response, we used TT-coated magnetic beads to isolate TT-binding cells from the spleen and bone marrow of hypervaccinated mice. One pool of mice, pool 2, showed an extreme response with the result that almost 17% of the repertoire is composed of one CDR3, CASYSNFDYW. Interestingly, this CDR3 is predominately composed of an IgM response, rather than the anticipated IgG response (data not shown). Although these data are from the pooling of two animals, the high repertoire percentage likely arose in a single animal. However, we found no difference in the TT-specific repertoire SIs as compared with the TARDIS TT + CpG1826 spleen or bone marrow. It has been previously established by multiple works (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) that the anti-TT response is very broad and highly specific, which may contribute to our overall detected diversity even when focusing on the Ag-specific response. It is also not unprecedented for memory IgM responses to occur (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>).</p><p id="P37">Given our large number of datasets and experiments, we attempted to isolate patterns in CDR3 usage by treatment, experiment, tissue, or other variables. The PCA revealed no patterns either within or across experiments. This lack of pattern is likely due to the highly individualized nature of CDR3 generation (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We have previously reported that when comparing CDR3s across the eight treatment groups in the TARDIS spleen data, over 90% of CDR3s were found in only one treatment group (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic> = 4). Even very-high-frequency CDR3 are at low frequency in other animals or treatment groups and, in some cases, not detected at all (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p id="P38">We also explored diversity in V-gene segment and J-gene segment usage in two high-frequency public clones. The first public clone explored was CARGAYW. This CDR3 was found in CASIS and TARDIS spleen animals and 15 of the 24 TARDIS bone marrow samples. Although CARGAYW occurred at very high counts (3598) in some animals, it occurred at much lower counts (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) in others. This is consistent with previous data published by Greif et al. (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) showing that public clones have variable frequencies. One specific V/J combination, V1&#8211;80/J2, was the predominant combination, with over 77% of the CDR3s formed from these two gene segments. V1&#8211;80/J2 (14.6%) and V1&#8211;80/J4 (6.1%) also contributed to the pairings. All other combinations (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) were found in &lt;0.5% of the sequences. Interestingly, our previous work has shown that V1&#8211;80 is one of the most commonly used V-gene segments in the mouse repertoire (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). In comparison, when we examined a longer CDR3, CARDSNWYFDVW, one combination (V9&#8211;3/J1) comprised 99.9% of combinations detected. The identification of the three other combinations (V3&#8211;5/J1, V1&#8211;22/J1, and V9&#8211;1/J1) may be the result of sequencing errors. Given the longer CDR3, it is less likely that multiple combinations could result in the same amino acid sequence.</p><p id="P39">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that changes in Ab repertoire diversity are detectable using next-generation sequencing data exploring CDR3 usage. We have demonstrated that trends or significant reduction in diversity occur in response to hindlimb suspension and TT vaccination in the bone marrow. A reduced diversity is also found in the bone marrow as compared with the spleen. However, comparisons of the anti-TT repertoire to the overall repertoire of the spleen and bone marrow revealed no differences in SIs. We also were not able to detect CDR3 signatures by experiment, treatment, or tissue. We examined the V/J combinations for two common public CDR3s and found more variation in V/J pairing in the shorter CDR3 when compared with the longer CDR3. Finally, from this large multidata, we observe that there is significant individual-to-individual CDR3 uniqueness. These data suggest that an animal&#8217;s Ab repertoire is quite unique, even in a highly inbred animal. Evolutionarily, this makes sense and maximizes the possibility that the unique repertoire will allow survival against the widest array of pathogens. This is not a new concept, but these data help to support that hypothesis. Additional sequences will be needed to solidify the hypotheses generated from our analyses.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p id="P40">We thank Dr. Alina Akhunova, Director of the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility, for sharing knowledge and dedication to our project.
