Here, we extend molecular work to energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. We found spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen signaling in rodents and humans. Murine changes were most prominent in the liver, where we observed inhibition of insulin and estrogen receptor signaling with concomitant hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Based on the metabolic demand, metabolic pathways mediated by insulin and estrogen vary among muscles, specifically between the soleus and extensor digitorum longus. In humans, spaceflight induced changes in insulin and estrogen related genes and pathways. Pathway analysis demonstrated spaceflight induced changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection. These data strongly suggest the need for further research on the metabolic and reproductive endocrinologic effects of space travel, if we are to become a successful interplanetary species.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">Analysis of data from mice having spent time at the International Space Station and from a group of astronauts and a set of commercial spaceflight participants reveals alterations in genes related to insulin and estrogen signaling during spaceflight</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Systems biology</kwd><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>80NSSC19K0883</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Beheshti</surname><given-names>Afshin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">We have entered an era in which living and working in space is a reality. Studies show that spaceflight has health risks such as central nervous system and cardiovascular dysfunction, cancer risk, immune dysregulation, muscle and bone loss, and fatty liver<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. At the molecular level, risks include oxidative stress, DNA damage, cosmic radiation exposure, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome shift, and epigenetic alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Of these, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have been identified as major space-related risks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Mitochondria are not only the powerhouse of the cell but also the center of many metabolic pathways. Insulin is a highly conserved anabolic and mitogenic peptide hormone that acts as a master regulator of energy metabolism across species, including humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. It is secreted by the pancreas in response to increased plasma glucose, and exerts its effects on most organs including the kidney and liver as well as skeletal muscle, and bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and undergoes autophosphorylation upon activation, leading to a downstream signaling cascade which influences cellular function, particularly glucose metabolism. Insulin resistance (IR) arises when these downstream molecular pathways do not respond appropriately in target tissues, thus impeding the physiologic response to insulin. In the physiological state, IR can also be observed due to opposing actions from counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon, glucocorticoids, and catecholamines. Insulin resistance is further associated with metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, lipid dysfunction, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), cardiovascular disease, retinopathy, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Each of these factors is also interconnected, thus resulting in a potentially vicious cycle.</p><p id="Par4">The presence of insulin resistance during spaceflight has been reported, and sex differences play a role, with female astronauts displaying better Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values than male astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Estrogen receptors are ESR1, estrogen receptor beta (ESR2), and G-protein coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER1). There are also estrogen-related receptors alpha, beta and gamma (ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG) which are structurally similar to ESR1 and ESR2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> but whose ligands are unknown.

Further, we find that estrogen signaling gene expression changes also occur in both spaceflown rodents and humans.</p><p id="Par33">In mice, the liver and soleus muscle were the tissues that displayed the largest changes in global gene expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). These tissues also displayed large changes in insulin and estrogen signaling gene expression (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). In the liver, insulin receptor (<italic toggle="yes">INSR</italic>) and downstream kinases <italic toggle="yes">AKT1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">AKT2</italic> were downregulated during spaceflight. These changes were accompanied by decreased expression of other insulin receptor signaling genes. The metabolic pathways directly controlled by insulin were inhibited, which resulted in activation of dysglycemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. This last prediction is particularly striking given the increase in liver mass in these mice in a prior study utilizing the same cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Hepatic steatosis is a direct consequence of insulin resistance and can in turn exacerbate insulin resistance, leading to the development of a metabolic syndrome, and thus resulting in a vicious cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Prior studies have reported that during spaceflight, mice developed hepatomegaly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and hepatic lipid accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. Further, the livers used in our analysis showed histologic evidence of lipid accumulation via Oil Red O staining in a prior study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Thus, our results suggest that disrupted insulin signaling may underlie these changes. In addition to the insulin signaling changes, the impaired estrogen signaling we observed (z-score&#8201;&lt;&#8201;&#8722;2), may contribute to hepatic insulin resistance.</p><p id="Par34">In rodents, both male and female estrogen receptor knockout mice display insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Further, both insulin and estrogen actively play a role in metabolism and our findings also suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction, previously reported during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, may be due to alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). PGC-1&#945;, encoded by <italic toggle="yes">PPARGA1A</italic>, is a master regulator in metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. <italic toggle="yes">PPARGC1A</italic> downregulation in the liver was observed in both insulin and estrogen gene expression changes. Additionally, estrogen regulates mitochondrial function and biogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In our liver data, downregulation of mitochondrial complex I, complex 2, and ATP synthase genes were observed in the estrogen signaling network (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Thus, alterations in insulin and estrogen signaling in the liver may contribute to whole body alterations in metabolism in response to spaceflight.</p><p id="Par35">Soleus muscle was the second most affected tissue in mouse studies. Soleus is a slow twitch (type I) muscle fiber, dense in mitochondria to provide sustained oxidative capacity for long-term demands. Prior studies show atrophy in the soleus muscle after spaceflight in both rodents and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, and differential gene expressions between soleus and EDL muscle in rodents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Myostatin (<italic toggle="yes">MSTN</italic>) controls muscle mass and has been reported to be upregulated in microgravity in the soleus muscle but not in EDL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>; we confirm this observation. Other muscle atrophy related genes, <italic toggle="yes">FBX032</italic> (Atrogin-1) and <italic toggle="yes">TRIM63</italic>, and mechanoreceptor <italic toggle="yes">PIEZO1</italic> were also downregulated in the soleus. The downregulation of <italic toggle="yes">FBX032</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">TRIM63</italic> suggest the decline in soleus muscle size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> is not caused by increases in muscle protein degradation. This is consistent with past reports that muscle protein degradation is not increased in flight, but rather that protein synthesis declines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Previous studies in astronauts have suggested that altered insulin signaling may underlie muscle atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Further, in a prior study from the same mission, mice soleus muscle weight was decreased by 19%, despite no change in body weight and being physically active in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. Given that insulin promotes protein synthesis, our finding of decreased expression in soleus of <italic toggle="yes">IRS2</italic> (Insulin receptor substrate 2), one of major downstream insulin signaling, suggests that insulin alterations contribute to declines in protein synthesis to promote muscle atrophy in flight; this is also consistent with suggestions from spaceflown <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. On the contrary, insulin receptor signaling was activated in the EDL (z-score: 2.52). Moreover, insulin-induced <italic toggle="yes">ACACA</italic>, a rate-limiting enzyme in lipogenesis, was upregulated indicating an insulin responsive state in the EDL. Further, the majority of the insulin signaling significant genes at the intersection of soleus and EDL were regulated in opposite directions, which shows distinctive insulin response in these muscles (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">Estrogen also promotes muscle growth, regeneration, insulin sensitivity, and controls muscle inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Estrogen-related receptor beta and gamma (<italic toggle="yes">ESRRB, ESRRG</italic>) induce mitochondrial function in myotubes and have a role in shifting muscle fibers towards oxidative types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. Muscle-specific <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> knockout mice models showed decreased oxidative metabolism, impaired mitochondrial fission and glucose metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Thus, our findings that <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> receptor was upregulated and <italic toggle="yes">ESRRB</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ESRRG</italic> were downregulated in soleus, while <italic toggle="yes">ESRRA, ESRRB, ESRRG</italic> were all upregulated in the EDL, suggest diverse actions of estrogen in muscle metabolism during spaceflight. Interestingly, while soleus size declined and EDL remained stable, as consistent with past studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, the gene expression changes in soleus and EDL were distinct with EDL displaying an enrichment for growth pathways (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), also consistent with prior studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Estrogen receptor signaling pathways were activated in both EDL and soleus muscles. Soleus muscle mass recovery is reported to be slower after hindlimb suspension in ovariectomized mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Additionally, increased estrogen receptor expressions were reported following muscle trauma in regenerating myofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Thus, estrogen receptor signaling activation and upregulation of <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> could be a compensatory mechanism against muscle disuse in the soleus muscle, whereas, in EDL the ESR signaling activation could support muscle growth and energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is another endocrine organ which is a part of cross-talk between muscle and liver. Our results are limited to muscle and liver, as adipose tissue was not available for analysis.</p><p id="Par37">Studies in humans have more constraints than in model organisms, thus for the present study we were limited to blood samples and skin in spaceflown humans. However, as insulin and estrogen are circulating hormones, changes in their effects should be detected in these tissues; albeit at lower levels such as in the non-liver and non-soleus tissues in rodents (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As with the worm and rodent data, changes in insulin resistance related genes were detected inflight and postflight. Postflight samples from human subjects displayed upregulated insulin signaling genes (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">AKT1, RARRES2</italic>) as well as enriched insulin secretion and PI3K/AKT signaling (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>), possibly suggesting decline in these pathways inflight. Additionally, postflight upregulation of the glucagon signaling pathway may indicate underlying postflight stress and may result in insulin resistance. Overall, postflight up- and down-regulated genes associated with insulin signaling displayed enriched lipid metabolism, hormones (i.e., estrogen, growth hormone, glucagon), circadian rhythm, and immune system pathways. Also, in the human data, we found the estrogen signaling pathway was enriched with insulin related genes. <italic toggle="yes">ESR1</italic> was upregulated within 2 months (R&#8201;+&#8201;3d, R&#8201;+&#8201;30d, R&#8201;+&#8201;60d) and then downregulated in the 3rd month (R&#8201;+&#8201;120d). In correlation with this finding <italic toggle="yes">CYP17A1</italic> was upregulated postflight. These findings may explain the enriched ovarian steroidogenesis and steroid hormone synthesis pathways seen postflight. Estrogen is closely related to the immune system, as an example, Treg cell distribution changes during menstrual cycles and increases during the follicular phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">In our data, dendritic cells in females showed higher enrichment scores in estrogen and insulin linked genes on R&#8201;+&#8201;45 than male counterparts (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10c</xref>). Sex difference was also observed in both rodent and human skin samples. In human skin, in the vascular region (VA) of the dermis, insulin resistance-related genes were more enriched in females during postflight while insulin and estrogen signaling-related genes were less enriched (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10d</xref>). In rodent skin samples, certain genes associated with tissue remodeling and collagen synthesis (i.e. <italic toggle="yes">COL1A1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">COL6A3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">COL6A1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">COL5A1</italic>) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>) were downregulated in male mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). Interestingly, increased urinary COL1A1 and COL3A1 levels have been reported in the NASA twin study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Insulin and estrogen both play an active role in skin homeostasis, and insulin resistance has been linked to certain skin conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Dermis is a connective tissue rich in vasculature, fibroblasts, collagen and elastic fibers, glands, hair follicles, and nerve endings. Both insulin and estrogen signaling exist in vascular endothelium and cause vasodilation via nitric oxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. Insulin-resistant states could impair vascular endothelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>. Estrogen promotes skin and mucosal epithelialization and proliferation. Studies reported positive impact of estrogen in wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup>. Clinically, topical estrogen is used in the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy, and it proliferates epithelium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Although our findings are limited by sample size, differences in the enrichment scores based on sex and skin compartments warrant future research on skin conditions after spaceflight in a sex and hormone-dependent manner. Further, due to our study setting, we cannot conclude on certain space-related environmental factors, such as lunar soil and dust, and their effects on insulin and estrogen signaling in the skin.</p><p id="Par39">In conclusion, we find insulin and estrogen signaling are altered during and after spaceflight in rodents and people. These changes impact metabolism and forebode comorbidities. One advantage of the rodent data is that genes for pathways of interest were examined in various tissues from the same sample cohort, including mice of the same strain and age. However, a key limitation of our study is the small number of human participants. Future studies should include different rodent strains, more human subjects, and different mission profiles to gain more knowledge on these genes/pathways of interest and expand our results. Particular attention should be paid to the effects on reproductive hormone synthesis and actions, as these impact a wide range of tissues, including bone health, energy metabolism and, of course species survival via reproduction.
