Here, it is demonstrated that BZR1, a BES1 homologue, also promotes cell divisions in the QC, but it suppresses columella stem cell differentiation, opposite to the action of BES1. In addition, BR and its BZR1-mediated signalling pathway are shown to alter the expression/subcellular distribution of pin-formed (PINs), which may result in changes in auxin movement. BR promotes intense nuclear accumulation of BZR1 in the root tip area, and the binding of BZR1 to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression in the root stem cell niche area. These BZR1-mediated signalling cascades may account for both the ectopic activation of QC cell divisions as well as the suppression of the columella stem cell differentiation. They could also inhibit auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation by antagonizing the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. In conclusion, BZR1-/BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways show differential effects on the maintenance of root apical meristem activities: they stimulate ectopic QC division while they show opposite effects on the differentiation of distal columella stem cells in a BR concentration- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent manner.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Auxin</kwd><kwd>brassinosteroid</kwd><kwd>BZR1</kwd><kwd>columella stem cell</kwd><kwd>PINs</kwd><kwd>quiescent centre (QC)</kwd><kwd>root apical meristem</kwd><kwd>root development.</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The apical regions of plant roots are composed of mitotically inactive quiescent centre (QC) cells and the surrounding meristemic stem cell initials (epidermal-lateral root cap initials, cortical-endodermal initials, stele initials, and columella initials), which form a &#8216;stem cell niche&#8217; (SCN) (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv316/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link> available at <italic toggle="yes">JXB</italic> online; <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Scheres, 2010</xref>). Each initial cell gives rise to the different root tissues, being the outermost lateral root cap, epidermis, ground tissue (cortex and endodermis), pericycle, and the innermost vascular tissues to make up a radial arrangement of root tissues. Along the longitudinal axis, the root is composed of a distal structure [lateral root cap and columella layers derived from the columella stem cell initials (CSCs)], the SCN, proximal meristem, transition zone, elongation zone, and differentiation zone (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Perilli and Sabatini, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). This cylinder-like concentric root structure is established by a balance between cell division in initials, stem cells, and meristematic cells of the proximal/distal meristems, and differentiation of these cells into diverse cell types in the elongation/differentiation zone. This balance is under the tight control of unknown QC-directed signals and environmental cues that regulate the spatiotemporal expression of master regulatory genes for cell fate determination (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Scheres, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011</xref>). In general, when asymmetric division of a stem cell initial occurs, the daughter cell that has contact with the QC remains as an initial cell whereas the other daughter cell&#8212;which is separate from the QC&#8212;divides to form transit-amplifying cells at the boundary of the proximal meristem (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Scheres, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Perilli <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Many hormones and protein factors have been shown to be involved in the specification and maintenance of QC and stem cell identity, and the resulting determination of radial and longitudinal patterning (reviewed in <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Bennett and Scheres, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Bitonti and Chiappetta, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>).

In this report, whether BZR1, a BES1 homologue, is also actively involved in BR-regulated QC regulation was tested. BZR1 is primarily localized in the nucleus of epidermal cells and some cortex cells of the proximal root tips of <italic toggle="yes">pBZR1:BZR1-YFP</italic> plants when they are grown in medium lacking BL (a type of BR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Similar localization of BZR1 was evident within 15min when BL was applied to 7-d-old seedlings (data not shown).

These observations, together with BL-induced intense nuclear localization of BZR1 in the QC, CSCs, and CCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>), prompted an investigation of the effects of BR on the maintenance and differentiation of distal CSCs by examining the development of starch-accumulated columella cells.</p><p content-type="indent">First, the cell layer number of QC, CSC, and CC was measured for Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>) and BR biosynthesis-defective <italic toggle="yes">de-etiolated2</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">det2</italic>; <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Noguchi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>) plants grown on media containing various concentrations of BL, ranging from 10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> to 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M. To do this, root tips were stained with PI by performing mPS-PI staining to mark cell walls and starch granules. As expected, BL stimulated division of the QC in a concentration-dependent manner in both Col-0 and <italic toggle="yes">det2</italic> plants. Less than 10% of Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried two layers of QC, and the proportion of plants with the divided QC was greatly increased after exogenous treatment with BL: 60% and 82% of Col-0 plants grown on medium containing 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M and 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M, respectively, contained two layers of QC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). In contrast, differentiation of CSC into CC was inhibited by the BL treatment. Most Col-0 plants grown on media lacking BL carried a single layer of CSCs, and only 15% of plants had two layers of CSCs. The proportion of Col plants with two CSC layers was moderately increased (25&#8211;30%) by the 10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> M to 10<sup>&#8722;11</sup> M of BL treatment, and it reached to 52% by the 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M BL treatment, which implies that BL inhibits CSC differentiation into CC. Consistent with this, treatment of exogenous BL reduced the number of CC layers. For example, Col plants grown without exogenous BL had 57% seedlings with four layers of CCs and 43% with three layers of CCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of plants with fewer CC layers steadily increased with increasing amount of BL treatment, so that plants grown on medium containing 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M BL showed 25% seedlings with four layers of CCs, 68% with three layers of CCs, and 7% with two layers of CCs. These concentration-dependent developmental trends of QC, CSC, and CC layers were clearly reproduced in BL-treated <italic toggle="yes">det2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Surprisingly, treatment of Col-0 plants with a higher concentration of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development: it promoted CSC differentiation and the resulting CC development. Seventeen percent of Col-0 plants grown on 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M BL had two layers of CSCs, which is far below the frequency compared with those of the plants grown on 10<sup>&#8722;15</sup> M to 10<sup>&#8722;11</sup> M of BL, and is about the same frequency as with mock-treated plants. Moreover, plants with no CSC (whose starch granules of cells resided underneath the QC were stained with PI) were present at a frequency of 18%, which was hardly observed in the mock- and lower BL-treated Col-0 plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). Consistent with this observation, an increased frequency of plants with a higher number of CC layers was observed in plants grown on medium containing 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M BL than in plants grown with lower concentrations of BL. Similar observations were previously reported in Col-0 plants treated with 4&#215;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M BL and the <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> BR gain-of-function mutant (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Garcia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in BL-treated <italic toggle="yes">det2</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Treatment of BR-deficient <italic toggle="yes">det2</italic> plants with higher concentrations of BL further increased the number of CSC layers and dramatically decreased the number of CC layers accordingly. These results strongly indicate that BRs differentially regulate distal CSC differentiation in a concentration-dependent manner: they inhibit the stem cell differentiation at low concentrations and promote it at higher concentrations. In support of data presented here, Col-0 plants grown on media containing BK, an inhibitor of BIN2 (a negative regulator of the BR signalling pathway) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">De Rybel <italic toggle="yes">et al,</italic> 2009</xref>) showed similar results to plants treated with lower concentrations of BL (data not shown). Also of note was that BL treatments not only modulated CSC differentiation, as determined by counting the number of cell layers stained with PI or below the stained cells, but also weakened the intensity of PI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2D</xref>). At the extreme, most Col-0 plants treated with 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M BL had 1&#8211;3 cells in the lowest layers that were not stained at all. This result implies that BR may be involved in starch development as well as differentiation of the distal meristem.</p><p content-type="indent">Next, to investigate the BRI1/BZR1-dependent regulation of QC division and CSC differentiation, the frequency of QC, CSC, and CC layers in diverse BR-related mutant plants was examined. As previously reported (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Garcia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> plants grown in MS media under the present experimental conditions showed enhanced QC reactivation and distal cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref>). Twenty percent of En-2 plants had two layers of QC and the remaining 80% carried a single QC cell layer. In comparison, more than 70% of <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> plants harboured two-layered QCs. Moreover, the proportion of <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> plants with no CSC also dramatically increased. It was found that 52% of the <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> plants had single-layered CSCs and the rest had no CSC, while 83% of En-2 plants carried single-layered CSCs and the remaining 17% had two-layered CSCs. In accordance, the frequency of plants with higher CC layers was increased in the <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> in that 16% of the plants had five layers, 39% four layers, and 45% three layers. In comparison, En-2 plants showed 3% with five-layered, 27% with four-layered, and the remaining 70% with three-layered CCs.</p><p content-type="indent">Comparing Col-0 plants with <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants, 17% of Col-0 plants had two-layered QCs and the remaining 83% showed single-layered QCs by 8 DAG on MS media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">E</xref>). In the same population of Col-0 plants, it was found that 90% of plants carried single-layered CSCs and a half developed four-layered CCs while the other half developed five-layered CCs. In comparison, the frequency of plants with single-layered QCs and CSCs in a BR-signalling defective mutant was slightly increased so that 98% of the <italic toggle="yes">bri1</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">116</italic> plants carried single-layered QC or CSC. This implies that a defective BR signalling pathway may result in retardation of QC or CSC cell division or differentiation. Development of CCs was also slightly inhibited compared with the Col-0 plants: 20% of <italic toggle="yes">bri1</italic>-<italic toggle="yes">116</italic> plants had five-layered, 72% four-layered, and the remaining 8% had three-layered CCs. Interestingly, a similar trend of reduction in CC layers was also observed in the BRZ-treated Col plants (data not shown). A BR-signalling enhanced mutant, <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic>, showed an increased frequency of plants with two-layered QCs as expected (80% with two-layered and the remaining 20% with single-layered plants). In addition, the frequency of plants with two-layered CSCs also dramatically increased (45% with two-layered and the rest with single-layered plants) as seen in the case of BL-treated Col-0 plants. Concurrently, the frequency of plants with fewer CC layers in the <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> mutant was greatly increased in that 32% of the plants had four CC layers and the remaining 68% had three-layered CCs. A double mutant of the BR signal pathway, <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic>, had a similar frequency of plants with QC layers to <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> and an intermediate frequency of plants with CSC and CC layers between <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-1D</italic>. These results imply that differentiation of CSC and the resulting development of CC are under the control of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, and that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, in opposition to BES1-mediated signalling, inhibits the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying development of starch-filled columella cells. In addition, it seems that a defect in either BR biosynthesis (in the case of BRZ-treated Col plants) or in the signalling pathway (in the case of <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic>) show similar results to BL treatment and BZR1-mediated signal enhancement.</p></sec><sec id="s12"><title>BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway partly acts on the auxin pathway and shows an antagonistic effect on auxin-stimulated CSC differentiation</title><p>The auxin signalling pathway that stimulates differentiation of CSCs requires activation of auxin responding factors, ARF10 and ARF16 and subsequent restriction of <italic toggle="yes">WOX5</italic> transcription in the QC (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Friml, 2010</xref>). Based on these findings, whether the inhibitory effect of the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway involves interaction with auxin activities in the distal area was examined. Ninety percent of Col-0 plants grown on MS media without exogenous BL carried a single-layered CSC and the remaining 10% of plants had two layers of CSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). In the same population, 23% of the Col-0 plants had five- or six-layered, 64% had four-layered, and 13% had three-layered CCs. As reported previously (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Friml, 2010</xref>), Col-0 seedlings grown on medium supplemented with an auxin (1-naphthaleneacetic acid, NAA) led to a decrease in CSC layers and a resulting increase in CC layers. For example, the frequency of plants with single-layered CSCs in NAA-treated Col-0 seedlings was greatly decreased to 52% from 90% in the untreated Col-0 plants. Moreover, 48% of the NAA-treated plants showed no CSC at all. Accordingly, the frequency of NAA-treated plants with more CC layers increased significantly: 30% of the auxin-treated plants carried six-layered CCs, 35% with five-layered, and the remaining 35% had four-layered CCs. Conversely, treatment of plants with an auxin action inhibitor (PEO-IAA, <xref rid="CIT0058" ref-type="bibr">Yoshimoto <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) increased plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers compared with those of Col-0 plants.</p><p content-type="indent">It has been shown in BL-treated Col-0 and <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants that the frequency of plants with a higher number of CSC layers was increased and the number of CC layers was decreased compared with those of Col plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs 2A</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">C</xref> and 3A). However, NAA greatly negated the effects of the <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> mutation, so that it led to a dramatic increase in the frequency of plants with fewer CSC layers and subsequent enhanced differentiation of CSC into CC layers, as in the case of Col-0 plants treated with the same chemicals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">B</xref>). For example, 32% of PEO-IAA-treated <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants carried no CSC layer while only 6% of the untreated plants had no CSC layer. For CC layers, 58% of PEO-IAA-treated <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants carried five-layered CSCs while only 5% were observed in untreated plants. In addition, treatment of PEO-IAA to the <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants slightly augmented the <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> mutation effect, so that the frequency of plants with more CSC layers and with fewer CC layers was slightly increased compared with the untreated <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants. For example, 45% of PEO-IAA-treated <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants carried two-layered CSCs while 31% of the untreated plants had two-layered CSCs. For CC layers, 72% of PEO-IAA-treated <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants carried four-layered CSCs while this was observed in 66% of the untreated plants. Nonetheless, it was noticed that treatment of NAA or PEO-IAA to the <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants did not completely lead to frequencies of CSC and CC layers observed in Col-0 plants treated by the same auxin-related chemicals. These results indicate that BZR1-mediated BR regulation on CSC differentiation and the following CC development partly act on the auxin action antagonistically, and a part of BZR1-mediated BR regulation for these developments may act in parallel to auxin.</p></sec><sec id="s13"><title>BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway alters the expression/subcellular distribution of PIN proteins resulting in proximal relocation of the auxin localization domain in roots</title><p>Auxin is synthesized at the shoot tip and transported down to the QC and columella initials in the root tip where the auxin maximum is formed (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Blilou <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Disruption of the auxin expression domain leads to defective development of the distal meristem (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Friml <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Based on the finding that BR acts antagonistically on auxin action in the regulation of CSC differentiation, whether BR modulates the auxin expression domain (auxin maximum) was examined in the root tip using <italic toggle="yes">DR5::GUS</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">DR5::GFP</italic> plants as auxin-sensing reporters. To do this, roots were stained by performing either a GUS activity assay followed by mPS-PI staining to reveal cell walls and starch granules together with auxin-accumulating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">C</xref>), or regular PI staining with live tissues to reveal cell walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Auxin gradually accumulated from the QC to the CCs with the highest concentration at the CSC, CC1, and CC2 areas in most plants grown on MS medium without BL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). About 35% of seedlings also showed auxin maximum at the root tip cells including the QC. Increasing the concentration of BL in the MS medium to 10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M shifted this expression domain longitudinally upward so that auxin was heavily concentrated at the QC, CSC, CC1, and the proximal area. For instance, more than 80% of BL (10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M)-treated <italic toggle="yes">DR5::GUS</italic> seedlings showed this pattern of auxin expression. Similarly, the <italic toggle="yes">DR5::GFP</italic> expression domain in <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants and <italic toggle="yes">mx3</italic> transgenic plants ectopically expressing the mutated form of <italic toggle="yes">BZR1</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">pBZR1::bzr1-D-CFP</italic>) moved to the proximal area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>). Consistent with the BL-driven proximal shift of the auxin maximum, BK treatment mimicking the BR-induced positive signalling pathway moved the auxin-accumulating domain to the proximal area, whereas treatment of the GUS reporter plants with BRZ reversed the BR effect on the maximum movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Interestingly, some <italic toggle="yes">DR5::GUS</italic> plants treated with 10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M BL resulted in enforced accumulation of auxin in the root tip area including the proximal zone, QC, and CCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). This is coincident with the finding that treatment of Col-0 plants with higher concentrations of exogenous BL resulted in opposite effects on CSC differentiation and CC development compared with those induced by lower concentrations of BL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">D</xref>). As expected, the gradual expression of <italic toggle="yes">DR5::GUS</italic> and correct establishment of auxin maximum were dramatically abolished in plants grown in medium supplied with NAA, in which auxin was uniformly accumulated in all root tip areas at a high level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4C</xref>). Supplying BL together with the NAA in the growth medium did not reverse this tendency, thus a high amount of auxin remained through the root tip.</p><p content-type="indent">The presence of the auxin maximum and the auxin gradient along the root are the result of collective activities and topologies of the PIN proteins (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Grieneisen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Specifically, PIN3, PIN4, and PIN7 play important roles in the positioning of auxin maximum and the following regulation of root patterning and distal meristem differentiation (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Friml <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">Blilou <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). To examine whether BR modulates transcript expression and protein localization of PINs in the root tip area, BL was applied to the root of Col-0 and PIN reporter plants for 3h or for 7 DAG and their gene expression and subcellular protein localization was examined. Interestingly, BL differentially regulated the expression of <italic toggle="yes">PIN</italic>s in a concentration-dependent manner: treatment of Col-0 roots for a short period (3h) with BR at low concentration (5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M) greatly suppressed expression of <italic toggle="yes">PIN3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIN4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PIN7</italic> genes whereas treatment with a higher concentration of BL (5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> M) resulted in enhanced expression of <italic toggle="yes">PIN7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>). A similar down-regulation of <italic toggle="yes">PIN</italic> gene expression was also observed for plants growing on a MS solid medium containing 5&#215;10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M BL for a long period (7 DAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>). This regulation of <italic toggle="yes">PIN</italic> genes, especially for <italic toggle="yes">PIN4</italic>, was dependent on BRI1-/BZR1-mediated signalling pathways so that gene expression of <italic toggle="yes">PIN3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIN4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PIN7</italic> was significantly enhanced in a <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic> background compared with the Col-0 plants. On the other hand, expression was significantly down-regulated (<italic toggle="yes">PIN4</italic>), slightly increased (<italic toggle="yes">PIN3</italic>) without statistical significance, or maintained at the Col-0 control level (<italic toggle="yes">PIN7</italic>) in <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Moreover, up-regulation of the <italic toggle="yes">PIN</italic> genes by <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic> mutation was partly negated by the <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> mutation background in <italic toggle="yes">bri1-116</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> double mutants. This <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> down-regulation effect of <italic toggle="yes">PIN</italic> genes resembles exogenous BL treatment at lower concentrations. In contrast, <italic toggle="yes">PIN7</italic> expression was greatly increased in <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> mutants, which resembles the gene expression in plants treated with a higher concentration of BL.

In contrast when BL was added to the incubation medium at a higher concentration (10<sup>&#8722;6</sup> M) for 3h, the PIN3 expression domain was restricted mainly to CC1 and CC2 and disappeared from CC3.

Taken together, these data indicate that BR-induced nuclear BZR1 regulates expression of several key root-controlling genes by binding to their promoters, which may be resulting in BR-induced modulation of root stem cell division and differentiation in the root tip area including columella cell layers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Discussion</title><p>A root is formed from a reservoir of undifferentiated cells, called root stem cells, in the root apical meristem. QC cells act as integrators for many processes and events that are requisites for root meristem establishment and maintenance. Previous studies proposed that QC cells might send short-range non-cell autonomous signals that help the initials remain in an undifferentiated state (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">van den Berg <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Scheres, 2007</xref>). CSC initials and the differentiated columella cells are longitudinally adjacent to the QC. Results presented here showed that BZR1- and BES1-mediated BR signalling pathways acted differentially in the regulation of the QC and CSC differentiation (see <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erv316/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link> at <italic toggle="yes">JXB</italic> online for a schematic model). Both pathways promoted ectopic QC cell division by down-regulating expression of <italic toggle="yes">BRAVO</italic> repressor while at the same time up-regulating <italic toggle="yes">ERF115</italic>, a positive regulator of QC division. In contrast, the effects of BRs in the regulation of maintenance and differentiation of the distal meristem were both BZR1-/BES1- and BL dose-dependent. The BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibited the differentiation of distal CSCs, thus delaying the development of starch-filled columella cells. In contrast, BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling showed opposite effects on differentiation of the distal meristem, as previously reported (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Gonzalez-Garcia <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). Similarly, application of low concentrations of exogenous BL (~ &#8804;10<sup>&#8722;10</sup> M) resulted in the inhibition of CSC differentiation, similar to the results of the BRI1/BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway, while higher concentrations of BL (&#8805;10<sup>&#8722;9</sup> M) stimulated CSC differentiation as observed in BRI1/BES1-mediated BR signalling. Similarly, <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> seedlings were resistant to BRZ (a BR biosynthetic inhibitor) in both dark- and light-grown conditions (<xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">Yin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) whereas <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> seedlings are resistant to BRZ in the dark but are hypersensitive in the light (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). It has also been reported that BES1 acts as a transcriptional activator while BZR1 was shown to be a transcriptional repressor (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">He <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">Yin <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). It is conceivable that differences in BZR1-/BES1-dependent signalling dynamics provide the basis of the concentration-dependent differential responses. In fact, expression of distal CSC-regulating genes, such as <italic toggle="yes">FEZ</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">BRN1</italic>, seem to be differentially regulated in <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">bes1-D</italic> plants.</p><p content-type="indent">BRs interact with multiple hormone signalling pathways in the regulation of root growth and development (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Lee <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">Zhu <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref> for review). Regarding the interaction with auxin, BRs act synergistically with auxin to promote lateral root development by increasing acropetal auxin transport (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and enhance plant tropic responses by promoting the accumulation of PIN2 from the root tip to the elongation zone (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Li <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Transcript profiling and ChIP-chip experiments have revealed that BZR1 binds to the promoters of many genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signalling (<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Sun <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). It has been demonstrated that BRs down-regulate transcriptional expression of <italic toggle="yes">PINs</italic> and change subcellular localization of their proteins, and thus may alter the auxin localization domain and subsequent root patterning. Supporting this model for BR-induced down-regulation of <italic toggle="yes">PIN</italic> genes in roots and the resulting antagonistic action of BR against auxin-induced CSC differentiation, it was recently proposed that oppositely patterned and antagonistic actions of BR and auxin maintain the stem cell balance and optimal root growth (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015</xref>). Epidermis-driven BR signalling and activity is not associated with changes in the expression level of stele-localized <italic toggle="yes">PINs</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">PIN1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PIN3</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">PIN7</italic>) (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Hacham <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), but modulates transcriptional expression of <italic toggle="yes">PIN2</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">PIN4</italic> and their accumulation in the epidermis/cortex and columella in a post-transcriptional manner (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Hacham <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). Thus, similar to the model proposed here, the authors proposed that BR-directed auxin distribution represents at least one mechanism that contributes to BR-mediated root growth. In particular, AtPIN4 mediates the sink-driven auxin gradient and the resulting auxin maximum in the QC and the columella initial, and thus controls signals for the QC to regulate auxin-driven root patterning. Consequently, the loss-of-function mutant <italic toggle="yes">Atpin4</italic> exhibits a divided QC, increased number of both CSC and CC layers, and increased root cap and swelling (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Friml <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Recent studies showed that auxin-induced repression of <italic toggle="yes">WOX5</italic> results in enhanced CSC differentiation (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Ding and Friml, 2010</xref>). The BL-treated plants and <italic toggle="yes">bzr1-D</italic> plants with enhanced BR signalling used here exhibited a decreased level of auxin in the distal root area and increased expression of <italic toggle="yes">WOX5</italic>. Concomitantly, they exhibited reactivated QCs, an increased number of undifferentiated CSC layers, and a corresponding decreased number of columella cell layers. In summary, these findings indicate that the BZR1-mediated BR signalling pathway inhibits auxin-dependent distal stem cell differentiation in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> roots through action that is antagonistic to the auxin/WOX5-dependent pathway. It is also possible that BR-driven nuclear BZR1 directly binds to the promoter of root-regulating genes such as <italic toggle="yes">PINs</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">BRAVO</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ERF115</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">FEZ</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">BRN1</italic>, and independently regulates QC division and the distal stem cell differentiation. Interestingly, abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression of <italic toggle="yes">WOX5</italic> and thus maintains quiescence of the QC and suppresses differentiation of the columella initials (<xref rid="CIT0060" ref-type="bibr">Zhang <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>). This phenomenon of ABA-induced <italic toggle="yes">WOX5</italic> expression and promotion of stem cell maintenance is opposite to the BZR1-mediated <italic toggle="yes">WOX5</italic> induction and reactivation of QC division in root tips that was observed in this study. Based on these apparently contradictory reports, it is highly plausible that differential regulation or mode of action of each hormone is involved in multiple cellular processes in distinctive root tissues or cell types, such as the QC, CSC, and CC. Therefore, it will be necessary to clarify their mode of action and interactomes by dissecting details of these regulatory frameworks and establishing their interaction with other hormones. It has been demonstrated that BZR1-mediated BR signalling and ETO1-promoted ethylene signalling pathways independently act on the QC reactivation event in a parallel manner. Supporting this observation, treatment of ethylene biosynthetic precursor ACC promoted QC division without promoting BZR1 nuclear accumulation in the QC (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Chaiwanon and Wang, 2015</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Decoding the BR-dependent regulatory network in a cell-type specific manner remains a significant challenge, and any information will be useful in mapping BR interactomes with different pathways and uncovering how distinct tissues are coordinated (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fridman and Savaldi-Goldstein, 2013</xref>). Here, it has been shown that the effects of BRs in the regulation of QC and distal meristem activities are both BL dose- and BZR1-/BES1-dependent. Nonetheless, when and how BRs control stem cell maintenance and differentiation in roots remains largely unknown. Therefore, future studies must clearly dissect the connections among the dose-dependent perception of BR signals in a cell or tissue, the downstream signalling molecules, and the subsequent developmental patterning occurring in roots. Traditionally, an ARF-binding <italic toggle="yes">DR5</italic>-based auxin-inducible reporter (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">Ulmasov <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Barbez <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>) and an Aux/IAA-based auxin signalling sensor (DII-VENUS; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Brunoud <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>) have been widely used to accurately map auxin response and distribution at high spatiotemporal resolution in a single-cell-based tobacco system and <italic toggle="yes">in planta</italic>. Thus, one useful approach would be to develop BR-specific sensors (reporters) and monitor real-time spatiotemporal changes in BR abundance in a cell or a tissue and perform computational modelling to establish BR distribution circuits during the developmental progress. In addition, the identification of BR-regulated target genes in a specific cell type or at a specific developmental time and clarifying their interactive regulation by other hormones will provide another level of understanding of BR-regulated meristem function in plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s16"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic toggle="yes">JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
