Exactly how immune mechanisms control <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> in immunocompetent individuals remains unclear. Here, we use transparent zebrafish larvae to visualize and quantify neutrophil and macrophage behaviors in response to different <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> strains. We find that macrophages form dense clusters around spores, establishing a protective niche for fungal survival. Macrophages exert these protective effects by inhibiting fungal germination, thereby inhibiting subsequent neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing. Germination directly drives fungal clearance as faster-growing CEA10-derived strains are killed better <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. Additionally, a CEA10 <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>-deficient strain with impaired germination is cleared less effectively by neutrophils. Host inflammatory activation through Myd88 is required for killing of a CEA10-derived strain but not sufficient for killing of an Af293-derived strain, further demonstrating the role of fungal-intrinsic differences in the ability of a host to clear an infection. Altogether, we describe a new role for macrophages in the persistence of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> and highlight the ability of different <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> strains to adopt diverse modes of virulence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to invasive fungal infections, including aspergillosis. However, healthy humans inhale spores of the fungus <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic> from the environment every day without becoming sick, and how the immune system clears this infection is still obscure. Additionally, there are many different strains of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic>, and whether the pathogenesis of these different strains varies is also largely unknown. To investigate these questions, we infected larval zebrafish with <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> spores derived from two genetically diverse strains. Larval zebrafish allow for visualization of fungal growth and innate immune cell behavior in live, intact animals. We find that differences in the rate of growth between strains directly affect fungal persistence. In both wild-type and macrophage-deficient zebrafish larvae, a fast-germinating strain is actually cleared better than a slow-germinating strain. This fungal killing is driven primarily by neutrophils while macrophages promote fungal persistence by inhibiting spore germination. Our experiments underline different mechanisms of virulence that pathogens can utilize&#8212;rapid growth versus dormancy and persistence&#8212;and inform future strategies for fighting fungal infections in susceptible immunocompromised patients.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM118027-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Huttenlocher</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01AI065728-10</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4386-9473</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Nancy P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19-12829-26</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4386-9473</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Nancy P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI113956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6761-1098</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Rosowski</surname><given-names>Emily E.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM008349-28</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0112-5262</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Raffa</surname><given-names>Nicholas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by R35GM118027-01 from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to AH, 5R01AI065728-10 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the NIH to NPK, and grant 19-12829-26 from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to NPK.

We used strains derived from Af293 and CEA10 that express YFP and GFP, tagged to cytosolic proteins.

Additionally, by 3 dpi, CEA10 fungal burden is significantly less than the initial dose. Af293 is never significantly cleared compared to the initial burden under the experimental conditions.

In a CEA10 infection, both a <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>+ strain and <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>- strain had significant levels of killing by 3 dpi and CFU counts from larvae infected with these strains were virtually identical 5 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). These data suggest that in wild-type larvae germination is not required for fungal clearance, although we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>-deficient spores do eventually germinate at later time points in infection.</p><p>To determine the requirement for germination in neutrophil-mediated killing, we determined the effect of <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic> deficiency in the specific context of CEA10 killing in <italic toggle="yes">irf8</italic><sup>-/-</sup> macrophage-deficient hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In these larvae, neutrophils effectively clear ~85% of CEA10 <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>+ fungal burden by 1 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g009">Fig 9D</xref>). However, a CEA10 <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>- infection is cleared significantly less in this context. At 3 dpi, there is no difference in <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>- fungal clearance between <italic toggle="yes">irf8</italic><sup>-/-</sup> macrophage-deficient larvae and wild-type larvae. These data indicate that <italic toggle="yes">pyrG</italic>-deficient CEA10 cannot be cleared by neutrophils, even in the absence of macrophages, suggesting that neutrophil-mediated clearance of CEA10 is dependent on germination. Together, these data demonstrate that germination drives neutrophil-mediated killing of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic>, and explain why a faster germinating strain is actually cleared more effectively by innate immune cells than a slower-growing strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat.1007229.g010" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1007229.g010</object-id><label>Fig 10</label><caption><title>Model of neutrophil and macrophage responses to <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus fumigatus</italic>.</title><p>Upon infection, <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> spores are taken up by macrophages, which form dense clusters around the fungus and inhibit spore germination.

Using a method to visually quantify spore killing, we find that faster-growing CEA10-derived strains of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> are cleared significantly better than slower-growing Af293-derived strains. We report that clearance of CEA10-derived strains is primarily due to neutrophil function and is driven by fungal germination, whereas slower-growing Af293-derived strains do not recruit as many neutrophils and therefore can persist in the host for &gt;5 days. Many fungal pathogens can survive within macrophages [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], but the role of macrophages <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> in <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> pathogenesis has remained ambiguous, and we find that macrophages form tight clusters around injected spores. Macrophages inhibit spore germination, and without spore germination, neutrophil recruitment and neutrophil-mediated killing are diminished, thus macrophages act as a protective niche against neutrophil-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g010">Fig 10</xref>).</p><p>The phagocyte clusters that we observe are reminiscent of aspergillomas or &#8220;fungal granulomas&#8221; that are found in lung or intracranial lesions of human patients [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. These macrophage-driven phagocyte clusters have never been observed before in an animal model of <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> infection, but phagocyte clustering is a common phenomenon in infections, with the mycobacteria granuloma as the classic example [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We do find some neutrophils infiltrating into these clusters and neutrophil aggregates have been reported in response to both to <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">Candida</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Zebrafish larvae have been an ideal model in which to detect phagocyte clusters, and they have been found in response to not just mycobacteria [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], but also <italic toggle="yes">Streptococcus iniaie</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">Mucor circinelloides</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>In tuberculosis, granulomas can provide bacterial-protective functions [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and macrophages can also act as protective niches for other pathogens [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic>, in larval zebrafish, macrophages do not have much spore killing ability, in contrast to what has been found <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], but in line with some <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> mouse experiments [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. While in other mouse experiments macrophage depletion led to an increase in <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> fungal burden [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we hypothesize that the protective niche function of macrophages is only relevant at lower doses of spores, not at the dose given in these experiments (~10<sup>7</sup>). Our data suggest that the protective niche function of macrophages arises simply by inhibition of fungal germination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g010">Fig 10</xref>). While it is also possible that macrophages actively repel neutrophils, as we have observed this behavior in other inflammatory contexts [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we cannot conclude this from the data presented here.</p><p>Neutrophils are highly efficient killers of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic>, and we find that this killing is largely dependent on germination. Whether neutrophils respond directly to signals exposed on hyphae or if epithelial cells and/or macrophages sense hyphae and recruit neutrophils in this context is not known. In mice, the neutrophil response to CEA10 is dependent on IL-1&#945; production [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling requires the Myd88 adaptor protein, but our experiments with <italic toggle="yes">myd88</italic><sup>-/-</sup> larvae demonstrate that Myd88 is not required for neutrophil recruitment and killing in this context. The Card9 adaptor can also transduce fungal signals to recruit neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and we hypothesize that this signaling is occurring in macrophage-deficient larvae to recruit neutrophils. Interestingly, in mice, neutrophil recruitment to Af293 and CEA10 infections is driven by different pathways and signals, in agreement with the differences we observe in the ability of these strains to recruit neutrophils [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>In addition to inducing neutrophil recruitment, germination likely also makes <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic> more susceptible to host killing mechanisms <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. In fact, we find that a slower-germinating Af293-derived strain is not effectively killed by the host even in a co-infection with a faster-germinating CEA10-derived strain. Hyphal growth and branching increases susceptibility to neutrophil-mediated killing <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], and it has long been thought that neutrophils are much more effective killers against hyphae than conidia [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. One immune mechanism that neutrophils use against hyphae is neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are observed in infected mouse lung tissue containing hyphae [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the absence of macrophages and the increased presence of hyphae we observed large masses of sudan black staining at the site of infection that are reminiscent of NETs. Sudan black stains neutrophil granules, and therefore these masses could be actual NETs, neutrophil degranulation, or simply massive neutrophil recruitment. It is worth noting that in imaging neutrophils expressing a cytosolic fluorescent protein recruited to the site of infection we could sometimes see a haziness in that channel suggesting neutrophil lysis, but could not prove the origin of this signal.</p><p>Differences in virulence between Af293 and CEA10 are also observed in murine models of <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> infection. In a chemotherapeutic model of immunosuppression, infection with either of these strains caused similar rates of host death [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a situation that may be similar to our dexamethasone-treated zebrafish larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1007229.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In a less immunosuppressed triamcinolone-treated mouse model, CEA10 is more virulent [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, this increase in virulence is thought to be a result of increased resistance to hypoxia, a hallmark of this model [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], while we do not know the hypoxic state of our zebrafish immunosuppression models. Murine studies have correlated the increased growth and germination of CEA10 compared to Af293 with increased tissue damage [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but have also found that increased growth <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> across multiple environmental and clinical isolates correlates with increased host survival in the triamcinolone-treated mouse model [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], possibly consistent with our findings that increased growth leads to increased host response and clearance mechanisms.</p><p>Between these strains of <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">fumigatus</italic>, we have identified two different virulence mechanisms, both of which are commonly observed in a variety of human pathogens. CEA10-derived strains can germinate quickly <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, and therefore under neutrophil-deficient conditions can cause disease and spread. On the other hand, Af293-derived strains do not germinate quickly but instead can persist largely undetected in the host. This latter mechanism is similar to one proposed for a different <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> species, <italic toggle="yes">A</italic>. <italic toggle="yes">terreus</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], and for the fungal pathogen <italic toggle="yes">Cryptococcus neoformans</italic> [<xref rid="ppat.1007229.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These two different mechanisms highlight the contradiction underlying <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> pathogenesis: while germination is required for virulence, it simultaneously activates the immune system and immune mechanisms that can kill the fungus. These ideas are relevant for the development and deployment of anti-<italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> treatments. Are there particular host scenarios in which it is better to simply inhibit germination and allow <italic toggle="yes">Aspergillus</italic> spores to persist? Or others where it is better to induce germination to activate host immune responses? Drugs that target macrophages to both maintain their ability to inhibit germination and increase neutrophil recruitment could provide the best possible scenario for future immunotherapies. Future investigation of the mechanisms behind each of these macrophage behaviors will be required to further understand the molecules and pathways involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec015"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec016"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal care and use protocol M005405-A02 was approved by the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Agricultural and Life Sciences (CALS) Animal Care and Use Committee.

In addition to pair-wise P values, this analysis also calculates hazard ratios, which are sometimes displayed. The hazard ratio can be interpreted as the relative death rate and represents the relative instantaneous risk of death throughout the experiment between two conditions. For quantification of imaging experiments (spore killing, intensity, cell counts, cluster area, or fungal area) and for CFU quantification, pooled data from three replicates was compared between experimental conditions using analysis of variance.
