Gravitropism involves mechanisms of perception, signal transduction and auxin-directed differential growth. According to the starch-statolith hypothesis, sedimentation of amyloplasts in response to gravity stimuli is critical for gravity sensing (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Masson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Gravity perception in Arabidopsis shoots depends on the ability to sense the position of starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, within shoot endodermal cells, or statocytes (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fukaki <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).

The sedimentation of amyloplasts in shoot statocytes is thought to trigger downstream signaling events, including changes in the transport of and response to auxin (<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">Rakusova <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The early events of signal transduction for gravitropism remain largely unknown, although several genes have been suggested to function in its early phases (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Blancaflor and Masson, 2003</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The current model of gravity sensing implicates the plant vacuole in the shoot gravity response (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Morita <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Yano <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Hashiguchi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Shoot endodermal cells contain a large central vacuole that occupies most of the cell volume, and its role in gravity sensing is well established.

A common phenotype in these mutants was the abnormal localization of amyloplasts in relation to the vacuole or abnormal vacuole morphology. In the case of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> mutants, the movement of amyloplasts in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem was greatly reduced (<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Yano <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Both VTI11 and SYP22 are SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins that have important roles in membrane fusion at the vacuole, including homotypic vacuole fusion (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Scheller, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">Wickner, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>
</xref>). Two mutant alleles of <italic toggle="yes">VTI11</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">impaired traffic to tonoplast3</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">itt3</italic>), have multiple vacuoles per cell (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Treatment of <italic toggle="yes">itt3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> with wortmannin (Wm), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), resulted in vacuole fusion, and enhanced hypocotyl gravitropism (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>
</xref>). This result is consistent with fragmented vacuoles being responsible for the agravitropic phenotype of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic>. Two other proteins associated with endomembranes were implicated in gravitropism. KAT2 is a membrane-associated protein (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Tamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), and SGR6 is a HEAT-domain containing protein involved in vacuole membrane remodeling (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hashiguchi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). The roles of KAT2 or SGR6 in gravitropism are still unknown.</p><p content-type="indent">A tight association between amyloplasts and the large central vacuole has been described in inflorescence endodermal cells. In resting cells, amyloplasts are found at the bottom of the cell, where they undergo saltatory movements and are almost completely surrounded by the vacuole membrane (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Morita <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">Yano <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Morita, 2010</xref>). Amyloplast sedimentation that results from changes in the gravity vector occurs inside transvacuolar strands (TVSs), and the amyloplasts remain tightly associated with the vacuolar membrane during this time (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Moirta <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). TVSs may allow movement of organelles, and their formation requires actin filaments (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Gao <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Leitz <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">Moirta <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). It is unclear if the F-actin inside TVSs is required for amyloplast association with the vacuole, sedimentation, or mechanisms of gravity perception (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">Morita, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Blancaflor, 2013</xref>), but F-actin cables have been shown to associate with sedimenting amyloplasts inside TVSs (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin-B in wild-type inflorescences (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Overall, the mechanisms by which amyloplasts are so closely attached to vacuolar membranes, including TVSs, and the role of this interaction for gravitropism have not been elucidated. Interestingly, <italic toggle="yes">kat2</italic> mutants, which are agravitropic in shoots, develop fewer transvacuolar strands in leaves and petioles (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">Tamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), but it is not known if this is the case for shoot endodermal cells. Even though a clear role for the vacuole in gravity perception is well established, the molecular mechanisms for vacuolar control or perception of amyloplast sedimentation has not been identified.</p><p content-type="indent">In addition to the vacuole, important roles for actin filaments have been reported, but their role during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Blancaflor, 2013</xref>). Actin depolymerizing drugs have been reported to enhance gravity response in hypocotyls (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>), reduce amyloplast sedimentation in endodermal cells (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Palmieri and Kiss, 2005</xref>) or have no effect in experiments with live cells (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). An important role of the actin cytoskeleton was demonstrated by the identification of the <italic toggle="yes">shoot gravitropism9</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">sgr9</italic>) mutant, which shows reduced amyloplast sedimentation due to increased interactions between amyloplasts and F-actin (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">SGR9</italic> encodes an E3 ligase that may disrupt the attachment of amyloplasts to F-actin during saltatory movements and as a result promote amyloplast sedimentation (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>). The difficulty of establishing a role of F-actin in gravity perception may be due to the complexity of interactions that it may have with a multitude of cellular components, including amyloplasts.</p><p content-type="indent">Here we used live-cell imaging on a vertical stage microscope to demonstrate the role of the large central vacuole in shoot gravitropism in seedlings. Our results identified the upper hypocotyl endodermis as the gravisensing tissue and highlight a novel tight interaction between the vacuolar membrane and amyloplasts.

Organelle morphology was analysed in hypocotyl cortical cells given the weak fluorescence of these markers in the endodermis.

Not surprisingly, TGN puncta were found both in the cell cortex and in the cytosol that surrounded fragmented vacuoles of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6C</xref>, D). Therefore, loss of <italic toggle="yes">VTI11</italic> does not appear to have an effect on TGN morphology. The mCherry-HDEL marker showed the canonical ER network organization at the cell cortex and ER bodies in WT (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">Nelson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6E</xref>, F). The ER was found surrounding the small vacuoles of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic>, similar to the other organelles, but two distinct abnormalities could be detected. First, the cortical organization of the ER was altered as there was enrichment of ER membranes in the cortical domains that abutted juxtaposed vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6G</xref>). In addition, aggregates of ER were found in the cytosolic domains between juxtaposed vacuoles and these appear to have restrictions in their movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6H</xref> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/erw418/-/DC1">Supplementary Movies S1 and S2</ext-link>). These aggregates of ER could result from accumulation of fusiform bodies at these sites, in addition to aggregated ER membranes, but these are difficult to differentiate at the resolution of a light microscope. These defects indicate that vacuole morphology is important for proper ER organization. To further test this possibility, we determined whether Wm treatment of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> would restore the cortical ER organization by promoting vacuole fusion. There were no apparent changes to the ER network in WT hypocotyls after treatment with Wm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">J</xref>), although membrane aggregates were sometimes observed.

A very small amount of Immersol allowed us to use a water immersion objective on the vertical stage, which provided optimal resolution. This unique set-up allowed us to track amyloplast sedimentation in real time and in whole plants without the concerns of plant injury. The system is amenable for cell biology analysis, including treatment with chemical inhibitors, and long-term time-lapse experiments. Furthermore, this system can overcome the challenges of imaging using stem cuttings, which have been shown to affect the vacuole morphology of certain mutants (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Hashiguchi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014</xref>). One caveat of our system is the need to illuminate the seedlings during image acquisition, which we have addressed with a green filter to minimize phototropic responses. Green light, however, has been shown to enhance hypocotyl growth and inhibit blue and red phototropic responses in dark-grown seedlings (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Folta, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Folta and Maruhnich, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">McCoshum and Kiss, 2011</xref>).

We used <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> and a second allele, <italic toggle="yes">itt3</italic>, as tools to interrogate the role of vacuole dynamics on gravitropism in Arabidopsis hypocotyls. As expected, WT endodermal cells from hypocotyl statocytes show a large central vacuole and sedimented amyloplasts that appeared surrounded by tonoplast membrane. This organization is very similar to that found in inflorescence stems (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Morita <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). In contrast, and consistent with other tissues (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>), smaller unfused vacuoles were detected in endodermal statocytes from <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> mutants, where the amyloplasts were found distributed almost randomly throughout the cell. In these cells, amyloplasts appeared trapped at the junction of juxtaposing vacuoles, and this organization seems to prevent amyloplast movement in <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic>, both before and after gravistimulation, as depicted by time-lapse experiments. Surprisingly, conditions of hypergravity up to 10 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> were not sufficient to force amyloplasts to sediment in these cells. It is unlikely that the fragmented vacuoles alone would be sufficient to prevent the movement of these organelles simply by creating physical obstacles to their movements along the cytosolic space. Therefore, we propose that a physical tether exists between the vacuole and amyloplasts that is of sufficient strength to resist a 10 <italic toggle="yes">g</italic> force. In fact in the case of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic>, each amyloplast seems attached to multiple vacuoles, which perhaps generates a strong physical tethering structure to resist this hypergravity pull. In contrast, hypergravity is known to increase amyloplast sedimentation and gravitropic curvature of other agravitropic mutants such as <italic toggle="yes">sgr2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">sgr9</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">pgm</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Toyota <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>

Amyloplast sedimentation has been shown to occur via transvacuolar strands (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Morita <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), and therefore we asked whether the fragmented vacuole phenotype of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> could impair TVS formation. In fact, <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> mutants formed very few TVS structures in epidermal cells when compared with the WT, which could contribute to the reduced sedimentation of amyloplasts inside their statocytes. This possibility is consistent with the phenotype of the <italic toggle="yes">sgr2</italic> mutant, which displays fewer TVSs than WT and is agravitropic (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Morita <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Treatment with Wm induces fusion and restores the vacuole morphology of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> (<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">Zheng <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2014<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). We used this assay to test whether the vacuole morphology phenotype of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> was necessary for their lack of amyloplast sedimentation and the role of vacuole morphology on this movement. As expected, Wm treatment increased amyloplast sedimentation in <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic>. The Wm-induced vacuole fusion may have this effect due to the following: (i) vacuole fusion could disrupt the putative tethers between amyloplasts and the vacuolar membrane proposed above and therefore increase mobility of these organelles; (ii) vacuole fusion could restore the ability to form TVSs, which could become conduits for amyloplast sedimentation; (iii) restoring the single vacuole phenotype could remove physical obstacles formed by the vacuoles themselves. We indeed confirmed that Wm-induced vacuole fusion increases the formation of TVSs in epidermal cells. However, TVSs alone are probably not sufficient because <italic toggle="yes">sgr2</italic> mutants, which do not form TVSs in stems, were able to reposition amyloplasts along a hypergravity vector (<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">Toyota <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2013<italic toggle="yes">b</italic>
</xref>). Future research is needed to address the role of a putative tethering system to determine if all three possibilities play a role in this response. The alternate possibility that Wm is actually affecting gravitropism through effects on cellular events unrelated to vacuolar function seems less likely as Wm action on gravity response is not seen in WT plants where these other sites of action would presumably still be present.</p></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Shoot statocytes comprise young endodermal cells near the top of the hypocotyl</title><p>The endodermal layer of the hypocotyl has been identified as the graviperceptive tissue in shoots (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Fukaki <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Visualization of endodermal cells in the medial region of the hypocotyl of etiolated seedlings indicated that most cells did not show the expected sedimented amyloplasts, and instead these organelles were in constant motion from cytoplasmic streaming. Only the smaller cells in the upper hypocotyl of an average length of 70 &#956;m or less showed sedimented amyloplasts that were consistent with graviperception. To confirm this result, we took advantage of the phenotype of <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> and Wm treatment. This provided a unique opportunity to test whether amyloplast sedimentation in <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> at the top or the bottom of the hypocotyl was associated with restoration of gravitropism. Adding Wm at the top of the hypocotyl enhanced gravitropism in these mutants, but the treatment at the bottom did not. Therefore, only Wm treatment at the top is sufficient to restore the gravity response. This effect is correlated with an increase in amyloplast sedimentation as shown by organelle tracking experiments. Altogether, these results indicate that the statocytes in etiolated hypocotyls are localized to the young endodermal cells at the top of the hypocotyl. These results are consistent with the top ~4 cm region of the inflorescence stem being sufficient for graviresponse in mature plants (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Fukaki <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 1996<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>
</xref>) and the finding that displacement of amyloplasts at the base of the inflorescence stem does not result in inflorescence bending (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">Weise <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s20"><title>The cytoskeleton is not involved in amyloplast tethering to <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> vacuoles</title><p>A role for actin during shoot gravitropic perception remains unclear (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">Yamamoto <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">Palmieri and Kiss, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Blancaflor, 2013</xref>). The inability of amyloplasts to sediment in <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> could be due to the fragmented vacuoles being obstacles for movement. However the fact that hypergravity is not sufficient to release them indicates that there may be physical tethers between the amyloplasts and the vacuole. We tested whether such tethers could be formed in part by cytoskeletal structures and, therefore, if they could be disrupted with inhibitors that depolymerize MT and actin microfilaments. However, neither Lat-B nor oryzalin treatment was sufficient to overcome the block in sedimentation. This is consistent with previous reports indicating that the tight association between vacuole and amyloplasts was not disrupted by lantrunculin B in wild-type inflorescences (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">Saito <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). However, these results are not consistent with experiments in flowering snapdragon shoots, in which depolymerization of actin microfilaments with Lat-B released amyloplasts (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Friedman <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). We conclude that the association between amyloplasts and the vacuole may occur either directly or indirectly but does not seem to involve the cytoskeleton. Contact sites between the vacuole and other organelles and association between those and amyloplasts may be responsible for the tethering that we have observed. Contact sites between plant subcellular organelles have been identified by electron microscopy or laser trapping, including between ER and plasma membrane (summarized in <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin, 1997</xref>), ER and endosomes (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">Stefano <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2015</xref>), and ER and Golgi (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">Sparkes <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The vacuole has also been shown in tight association with the cytoskeleton (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">Scheuring <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, 2016</xref>) and the ER (<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">Staehelin, 1997</xref>), and the latter may provide an anchoring system that may be important to regulate amyloplast sedimentation. Future analysis by electron microscopy in shoot endodermal cells may provide further support for these contact sites. The dramatic effects on ER morphology in the <italic toggle="yes">zig-1</italic> mutant indicates that ER&#8211;vacuole interactions are critical for organelle structure. Given that no major changes in organelle morphology or distribution were observed for the TGN, we conclude that the vacuole is unlikely to form physical attachments with these organelles as it does for amyloplasts.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s21"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>Supplementary data are available at <italic toggle="yes">JXB</italic> online.</p><p>
