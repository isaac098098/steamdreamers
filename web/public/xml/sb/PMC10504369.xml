Spaceflight elongates human telomeres in peripheral blood, which shorten upon return to Earth and approach baseline levels during postflight recovery. Astronauts also encounter muscle atrophy, losing up to 20% loss of muscle mass on spaceflights. Telomere length changes in muscle cells of astronauts remain unexplored. This study investigates telomere alterations in grounded mice experiencing radiation exposure and muscle atrophy, via a hindlimb unloading spaceflight mimicking model. We find telomere lengthening is present in muscle stem cells and in myofiber nuclei, but not in muscle-resident endothelial cells. We further assessed telomere length in the model following hindlimb unloading recovery. We find that telomere length failed to return to baseline values. Our results suggest a role for telomeres in muscle acclimatization, which is relevant for the well-being of astronauts in space, and upon their return to Earth.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Stem cells</kwd><kwd>Cell biology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>80NSSC19K1602</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Mourkioti</surname><given-names>Foteini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL146662</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Mourkioti</surname><given-names>Foteini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2023</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In the vacuum of space, astronauts are continuously bombarded by high energy cosmic radiation and must perform missions in microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. A better understanding of the consequences of these two factors on body function and physiology are crucial for the planning of safe and successful long-duration future missions. A major detriment experienced by astronauts in flight is muscle atrophy, where a 1 month spaceflight can reduce muscle mass by 20% and muscle strength by 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Even with currently implemented spaceflight countermeasures, involving rigorous exercise, the deleterious physiological effects of spaceflight in muscle atrophy and weakness induction are not completely abrogated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition to microgravity, astronaut exposure to cosmic radiation can have effects on body systems that are still being elucidated. It is well established that the skeletal muscle atrophy due to exposure to both microgravity and radiation is problematic because of its rapid onset and severity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Muscle stem cells (MuSCs), also called satellite cells, are necessary for muscle formation in embryogenesis and for muscle growth during childhood and adolescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In healthy adults, MuSCs from undamaged muscles remain quiescent. Following injury, such as that arising from strenuous exercise, MuSCs become activated, proliferate, and differentiate in a series of coordinated steps, to properly repair muscle damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In the context of muscle atrophy, MuSC properties are less clear. Atrophy caused by cancer cachexia is known to activate specific signaling pathways in skeletal muscles related to inflammation, protein synthesis, and autophagy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In satellite cells, atrophy-induced signaling exerts effects on MuSC proliferative potential and differentiation capacities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In terms of effects of radiation exposure to MuSCs, limited data are available. Exposure of cultured human muscle progenitor cells to ionizing radiation has negative effects on proliferative capacity and alters inflammatory signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Studies using chronic, lower dose, whole-body irradiation of mice resulted in reduced MuSC numbers, reduced proliferative capacity, and increased quiescence, but it had little effect on differentiative capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Higher dose leg-specific radiation exposures have demonstrated similar results on reduced proliferative capacities of juvenile mice; however, myofiber sizes and MuSC differentiation effects were present as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, suggesting that level and duration of exposure could have different effects on MuSCs, depending on these factors.</p><p id="Par4">The length of telomeres is an important parameter of tissue proliferative potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Telomeres are repetitive sequences located at the ends of chromosomes, which can function as cellular proliferation clocks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Telomere attrition leads to loss of cellular functionality and can lead to stem cell exhaustion in diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Shortened telomeres are also correlated with atrophy of many organ compartments, including brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, spleen, small intestine, and reproductive system, among others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Additionally, it has been reported that telomeres in cultured mouse and human fibroblasts appear more susceptible than other regions of the genome to DNA damage, and they exhibit a persistent DNA damage response following X-ray irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Increased DNA damage found at telomeres has been associated with telomere attrition and/or uncapping and cellular senescence, leading to loss of proper cellular functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recently, the effects of spaceflight have been meticulously investigated in the NASA Twins Study, where effects of preflight, inflight, and postflight conditions on a monozygotic twin were measured by multiple metrics and compared with the grounded twin brother<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. That study revealed telomere lengthening in T cells of the inflight astronaut, which rapidly shortened postflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Another study investigating different astronaut flight conditions found similar results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, despite the importance of maintaining skeletal muscles during spaceflight, telomere length metrics in astronaut muscles have not been assessed.</p><p id="Par6">The goal of this study was to measure telomere length in resident skeletal muscle cells of grounded, wild-type mice experiencing spaceflight-like conditions, using a whole-body irradiation (IR) and hindlimb suspension (HLS)/mechanical unloading approach.

In our experimental design, mice were divided into four different cohorts: control (without IR exposure, without hindlimb suspension (HLS)), HLS only (no IR), IR only (no HLS), and combined (HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR); (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). More specifically, wildtype mice were pre-exposed to 2&#8201;Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not. Following a 3-week time course, mice were sacrificed, and various tissue weight metrics were obtained. We found that at the study endpoint, mouse whole-body weights were similar for all groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), demonstrating that HLS did not detrimentally affect mouse appetite. This finding is especially important, since hindlimb unloading has been used as method to study behavioral despair and depression, and appetite changes, if any, could have influenced our study results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Schematic of experimental groups used for the study.</title><p>Mice were pre-exposed to 2&#8201;Gy whole-body irradiation or sham irradiated and further divided into groups experiencing HLS or not.

We found IR exposure alone had no effects on kidney or spleen weights, but it did cause significant (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001) reductions in testes weights, when compared to sham/control mice (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1a&#8211;d</xref>). These findings are in agreement with previous studies in mice and humans exposed to IR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. HLS also had deleterious effects on testes gross size and normalized weight (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>a, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">d</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001), consistent with a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Additionally, kidney weights in HLS and HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR groups were slightly increased compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>a, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">c</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0452, 0.0705, respectively), a finding that was similarly reported in a rat HLS model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. No differences were found in spleen and kidney weights in combinatorial HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR versus respective controls; however, the testes HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR group displayed additive detrimental effects on testicular weight, relative to individual groups, consistent with prior literature on organ size changes from HLS and/or IR exposures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">To assess the effects of these experimental conditions on skeletal muscles, muscles were dissected post-trial and the level of atrophy was queried (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). We found little difference in tibialis anterior weights from mice that underwent HLS, and quadriceps weights were variable, compared to respective controls (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b&#8211;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">d</xref>). However, gastrocnemius muscles did exhibit a significant muscle atrophy in HLS and HLS + IR groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0490, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0138, respectively), leading us to focus on this muscle for the duration of the study. To confirm that gastrocnemius weight reductions affected muscle fibers, muscles were cryosectioned and stained with fluorescently-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which labels extracellular matrix regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. We observed significantly smaller fiber sizes in both HLS and HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR groups, relative to control and IR groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, g; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0399, respectively), further validating the muscle atrophy effect. In aggregate, these data unequivocally demonstrate a positive correlation between HLS and gastrocnemius muscle atrophy that agrees with the muscle wasting seen in previous HLS models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and which mimics that described in astronauts during spaceflights<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Telomere length dynamics in spaceflight mimicked muscles</title><p id="Par10">In the Twins Study, Garrett-Bakelman et al. demonstrated a significant lengthening of telomeres in circulating blood cells (T cells) in the astronaut twin while in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, telomere lengths in muscle cells were not measured. Using a HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR spaceflight-mimicking system, we wished to query the effects of telomere length on several skeletal muscle-resident cell types. First, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH staining of telomeres on gastrocnemius cryosections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. With this method, relative telomere length was determined by intensity measurements of a fluorescently labeled telomeric peptide nucleic acid probe, normalized to the fluorescence intensity staining of the entire nucleus by DAPI staining. Cells of interest were identified by additional immunostaining to mark desired cells and/or the cellular positions within the muscle. We first queried telomere length in MuSCs, defined as VCAM+ cells that appear in the satellite cell position (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Quantification of telomere length revealed no changes between control, HLS, or IR MuSCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). However, when HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR MuSC telomeres were assessed, we found significant telomere lengthening, as compared to all other groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). To evaluate the cellular consequences of these alterations, we evaluated MuSC populations and properties. We first assessed whether there were changes in MuSC numbers in atrophied muscles, as had been suggested previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Gastrocnemius cryosections were stained with the MuSC marker, Pax7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and total number of positively stained cells per unit area was queried. We found no changes in MuSC numbers between control vs IR, and control vs HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR treated groups, while a significant increase in MuSC numbers was observed in the control vs HLS only group (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>a, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">b</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.0001). While these findings are interesting and unexpected, they did not correlate with the observed changes in telomere length of the HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR group. To exclude other cellular defects associated with telomere length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, we also investigated whether MuSCs were undergoing senescence in response to our experimental manipulations.

Since our data demonstrated telomere lengthening in HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR MuSCs, we next sought to determine whether telomere length in these cells also shortened following a recovery period, where mice were returned to conventional mobility. To assess this possibility, HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR mice were allowed to recover for 2 weeks, with unrestricted movement and normal muscle loading. For this arm of the study, control, HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR, and recovery groups were compared (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). First, we assessed normalized organ weights and found no significant changes to normalized spleen weights (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4a</xref>) and kidney weights (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4b</xref>) between the groups.

Together, these data confirm that the recovery did not interfere with general organ mass. In assessing the effects of recovery on skeletal muscles, we observed that gastrocnemius muscles of recovered mice were larger than HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR mice and were of similar size to controls (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.9927), demonstrating that 2 weeks post-unloading is sufficient to regain normal skeletal muscle size. To evaluate telomere length alterations in the recovered muscles, we performed CRYO MuQ-FISH in the gastrocnemius-derived MuSC populations and myonuclei between the experimental groups. Surprisingly, we did not observe telomere shortening in the recovery MuSCs, but instead they retained elongated telomere length and continued to increase even further, relative to the HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>; <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.0186). Similarly, telomere length in myonuclei also remained elongated following recovery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>), which also trended higher but was not significantly different compared with the HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR group (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.4288). To further delineate whether there were differential telomere length changes in muscle cell populations, which may have been buried by the averaging of telomere length analysis, we plotted this dataset as a distribution on a per cell basis (Supplementary Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). These data show, that unlike what was reported for T cells in the Twins Study, where a proportion of the return to Earth cells exhibited population of critically shortened telomeres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we found few MuSCs with very short telomeres and many more MuSCs with long telomeres.

A better understanding of the causes of such impediments to explorer health in an earthbound model could serve beneficial effects in the development of additional countermeasures or prophylactic treatments meant to reduce physical health burdens.

One reported aspect of this study was an observed effect of telomere lengthening in peripheral blood T cells during spaceflight, which was absent in the grounded twin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Outside of space, telomere length changes have been reported in degenerative diseases, which often coincide with tissue atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, including skeletal muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, telomere length alterations in skeletal muscle cells, both from mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>, are not correlated with the effects of aging, where sarcopenia, a muscle wasting process, is a hallmark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. Although muscle deterioration is a serious problem in astronauts&#8217; health, the effect of gravity changes on telomeres of muscle cells has not been studied. In addition, the impact of the effects of radiation on telomere length are still inconclusive. A study of Chernobyl radiation cleanup workers demonstrated that occupational exposure to ionizing radiation led to telomere lengthening in these workers in peripheral blood leukocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Similar effects were reported for atomic bomb survivors, but only those who were exposed to lower doses of radiation, as higher dose radiation exposure led to telomere attrition in peripheral blood T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. However, studies on telomere length following radiation exposure, specifically focusing on the muscle compartment, are nonexistent. Most importantly, the combined effect of weightlessness-induced skeletal muscle atrophy and cosmic radiation exposure reported during spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> led us to query whether these factors can contribute to changes in telomere dynamics in myogenic cells in a ground-based mouse model.</p><p id="Par18">HLS in rodents is a common model used to study the effects of ground-based muscle atrophy, through mechanical unloading and skeletal muscle disuse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Using this HLS strategy in mice, we observed ~20% reductions in gastrocnemius muscle, similar to what has been previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Despite this loss of muscle mass, no changes in telomere length in the HLS model alone were evident, suggesting that simulated weightless conditions alone are not sufficient to modify telomere length. To mimic cosmic radiation exposure in spaceflights, we exposed mice to whole-body ionizing radiation by itself or utilized a combined approach of HLS and irradiation. Under these conditions, we found telomere lengthening only in myogenic cell types in the HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR group but IR exposure alone had minimal impact on telomeres. Intriguingly, endothelial cells present in the affected muscles do not exhibit significant telomere length changes in either group, suggesting that telomeres within skeletal muscle cells are more susceptible to telomere length changes in our experimental system. Overall, the telomeres in combined radiation exposure and simulated microgravity conditions demonstrated a synergistic telomere lengthening effect when applied together, specifically in myogenic cells but not in other cells with the muscle architecture.</p><p id="Par19">Although many detrimental health effects are associated with telomere shortening<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>, a growing body of evidence suggests that very long telomeres may be problematic in human cells, as these telomeres could develop instabilities and telomeric fragility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>, supporting the notion that tight control of telomere length homeostasis is essential. In line with this statement, in the Twins Study, the return to ground astronaut demonstrated a rapid shortening of telomere length, within 48&#8201;h after landing, to levels below earthbound twin, and telomere length extended but still remained shorter than the earthbound twin, even after 9 months<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Similar findings were found in other astronaut studies as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. To query whether telomere shortening occurred within skeletal muscle cells of our experimental design, we implemented a 2-week recovery period, where mechanical loading of hindlimb muscles was reestablished. The longer 2-week endpoint compared to the initial 48&#8201;h used in the Twins Study was also chosen due to the fact that skeletal muscles cannot significantly recover from atrophy conditions following 48&#8201;h of mechanical loading<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. In contrast to the overall telomere shortening of T cells in astronaut studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, we found that the telomere length of skeletal muscle cells failed to return to baseline levels, despite the recovery of muscle mass.</p><p id="Par20">The most common mechanism of telomere elongation is through the action of the enzyme telomerase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. A role for telomerase in spaceflight-induced telomere elongation has been suggested for peripheral T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, telomerase activity measurements in astronaut studies could not be measured midflight, as the activity of TERT in tissue samples was &#8220;lost in space&#8221;, likely hampered by the harsh conditions the samples experienced before returning to Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In the mouse study presented here, TERT expression in skeletal muscles was low and coincided with low telomerase activity in our experimental groups. These findings are in agreement with a prior report that showed telomerase activity is lost in differentiated skeletal muscle cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and suggest that telomerase has minimal role in telomere elongation in this experimental paradigm. However, it cannot be ruled out that transient telomerase activity in small proportions of myogenic cells contributes to our observed telomere-lengthening phenotype. Our investigation into additional modes of telomere lengthening uncovered preliminary evidence of an alternative lengthening (ALT) mechanism engagement. ALT was originally discovered in immortalized cell lines and subsequently shown to occur in some human tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup> While evidence is mounting that ALT can be regulated by environmental and genetic factors in rapidly proliferating tumor cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, its modulation and engagement in quiescent non-cancerous cells has not been explored, particularly while maintaining tissue structure. In quiescent skeletal muscle myogenic cells, we found that there is a substantial downregulation of the chromatin remodeler <italic toggle="yes">Atrx</italic> and the histone chaperone <italic toggle="yes">Daxx</italic> in both the HLS&#8201;+&#8201;IR and the recovery muscles compared to controls. The biological underpinning of this downregulation in muscles remains unknown. Observed telomere lengthening, in conjunction with low telomerase activity and reduction of <italic toggle="yes">Atrx</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Daxx</italic> expression, are suggestive of the engagement ALT-type mechanisms. In support of our findings, recent evidence has shown telomere lengthening in the blood cells of Mount Everest climbers during different points of peak ascent. Based on gene expression analyses, <italic toggle="yes">TERT</italic> was downregulated and <italic toggle="yes">RAD50</italic> was upregulated, while ALT and telomere maintenance via recombination pathways were enriched as the climbers progressed upwards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. These high-altitude studies, in which radiation exposure is higher than sea level, add weight to the validity of our findings of ALT-related pathway engagement over a relatively short time frame.</p><p id="Par21">A conundrum of our findings relates to the fact that cells of undamaged adult skeletal muscles are quiescent, including the myogenic cells of our study. Since ALT utilizes some of the same players of homologous recombinational (HR) repair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, a DNA double-strand break repair mechanism that is most active during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>, our findings are unexpected. However, there is substantial evidence that HR can occur in the G1 phase of the cell cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> and in postmitotic neurons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup>. In addition, HR in general occurs at similar frequencies in ALT proficient and ALT-deficient human cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>, which adds an additional level of complexity to the understanding of ALT processes. Thus, it is therefore possible that telomerase-independent lengthening may be occurring in our experimental system, and that reduced expression of <italic toggle="yes">Atrx</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Daxx</italic> supports the plausibility of a mechanism with features of ALT contributing to our observations. Until more details emerge on how molecular signatures associated with ALT are governed in nondividing, non-cancerous tissues, the specific mechanisms controlling telomere lengthening in a cell type-specific manner in our experimental design, or in the environment of space, remain elusive.</p><p id="Par22">Overall, this study examined the relationship between skeletal muscle cells and telomere length dynamics following hindlimb suspension and irradiation. While these findings are not extendable to post-flight measurements of astronauts, the experimental design applied here can be of use for preassessments of space-determined factors that modulate telomere dynamics and skeletal muscle functionality. One limitation of our study is that we only use males. Recent studies have demonstrated no sex difference in adult telomere length in vertebrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, thus including female mice in our study is unlikely to change the interpretation of the mouse results. Yet, studies in humans have revealed differences in telomere length between sexes, depending on the age examined and the methodology used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Thus, subsequent studies should consider telomere differences between sexes, especially given the rise in the number of female astronauts participating in space missions, and other reported differences in additional metrics between the sexes in other spaceflight studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. In any event, the data presented herein demonstrate that a ground-based model may be a useful starting point in elucidating the mechanisms governing telomere elongation dynamics in muscles of astronauts during spaceflight.</p><p id="Par23">Another limitation of this study is the type and dose/dose-rate of radiation exposure and how it relates to astronauts&#8217; occupational exposure. The space radiation environment is comprised of high energy protons and galactic cosmic radiation, including but not limited to electrons, protons, and heavier densely ionizing charged particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Additionally, radiation sources in space are not constant, and the absorbed dose varies between mice and humans varies, at least for proton radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Our experimental outcome in ground-based rodent muscle utilized a single exposure to a single ionizing radiation source, as it was not feasible to reload rodent hindlimbs for possible successive radiation exposures. To ensure radiation exposures were sufficient during our experimental window, we utilized a radiation dose of 2&#8201;Gy, which at current standards, is higher than NASA occupational exposures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">A major difference between mice and humans is telomere length, with many mouse strains having &#8764;8-fold longer telomeres than humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>, and they exhibit much faster rates of telomere shortening than humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. This greater telomere reservoir could endow muscle cells in in-bred strains of laboratory mice with a protective effect in spaceflight, but it is equally as possible that telomere changes are more easily studied in rodent models because of their differences compared with humans. Skeletal muscle cell telomere length was not examined in astronaut studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, and muscle biopsies of astronauts in space are rare, as the risk of complications to their health or possibly jeopardizing the missions is too great. Thus, future investigations using animal models in spaceflight would presumably mimic the muscle defects seen in astronauts and would be invaluable. Given the differences in telomere length between typically used research mouse strains and humans, future studies could be further strengthened by utilizing more humanized mice in regard to telomere length, such as the CAST/Ei J strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. After being exposed to the same weightless and cosmic radiation conditions as humans, these mice may be useful to further investigate behavior and function of different cell types in relation to their telomere changes.</p><p id="Par25">In conclusion, the data presented here lay a foundation for future studies to explore telomere length regulation in skeletal muscles during spaceflight conditions, to investigate whether ALT drivers exert cell type-specific influences on telomere length, and how long these changes last and how they contribute to health risks in astronauts after they return to Earth. Identifying the cellular and molecular muscle changes associated with telomere lengthening, as well as how ALT-related processes affect spaceflight-exposed cells, may yield important clues for future prophylactic therapy of astronauts&#8217; muscles, both during space flights and upon return to Earth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mice</title><p id="Par26">Male C57Bl/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Labs (stock# 000664) and used between 2 and 4 months of age.
