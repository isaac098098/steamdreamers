Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, <italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic> cv &#8216;Outredgeous,&#8217; plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24&#8211;72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 &#8211; 4.86 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts&#8217; diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lettuce</kwd><kwd>microgravity</kwd><kwd>ISS</kwd><kwd>phyllosphere</kwd><kwd>rhizosphere</kwd><kwd>space</kwd><kwd>microbes</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="8"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="87"/><page-count count="15"/><word-count count="0"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Crop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">MacElroy et al., 1992</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Kliss et al., 2000</xref>). Fresh produce can be grown <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> to supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety. Veggie is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by Orbital Technologies Corporation (Now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to grow vegetable crops in space (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Morrow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Morrow and Remiker, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The first Veggie plant growth chamber was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in April, 2014 along with eighteen plant (rooting) pillows for the VEG-01 experiment. Veggie is a simple plant growth facility that uses LED lights and fans to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. A transparent, extensible bellows attached to the light unit via magnets contains the growing plants and any debris, and directs air flow from the bottom of the canopy to the top of the growth volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Screens remove large particles from the cabin air before it passes through the plant growth chamber, however, no level of filtration is present, so plants growing in Veggie are exposed to any microbial or chemical constituents present in the ISS environment. More details about the Veggie facility can be found in <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al. (2016)</xref>. For the VEG-01 and VEG-03 demonstration tests, plants were grown from seeds in plant pillows. Plant pillows are small growing bags that interact with a root mat water reservoir on the Veggie baseplate. Pillows contain a calcined clay substrate mixed with controlled release fertilizer and wicks for seed attachment. Surface sanitized seeds are glued into these plant pillow wicks, and pillows are packaged for flight under sterile air. Further details of seed and pillow preparation are provided by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al. (2017b)</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Veggie payload containing a crop of mature red romaine lettuce in Veggie pillows aboard the ISS with the light panel off <bold>(left)</bold> and red light panel on <bold>(right)</bold>.

Ongoing testing has indicated that some essential human nutrients are either deficient in the processed and pre-packaged space foods (e.g., potassium, Vitamin K) or may degrade to inadequate levels over the times required for long duration missions (e.g., Vitamin B1, Vitamin C) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Cooper, 2013</xref>). Several of these nutrients may be supplemented through fresh salad crops and will provide antioxidants and phytochemicals in a natural, whole-food form. Previous studies with salad crops have focused on combinations of environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration) needed to optimize plant growth for space settings (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). While the macro nutritional value of crops was often evaluated in productivity studies (calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates), micro nutritional data are limited (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">McKeehen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">Wheeler et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In order to utilize &#8220;pick-and-eat&#8221; produce such as the lettuce crops grown in VEG-01 and 03 as a supplemental food for space, nutritional assessment is essential. In this study we compare the nutritional quality of red romaine lettuce (<italic toggle="yes">Lactuca sativa</italic>, cv. Outredgeous) grown on ISS to ground controls grown under the same ISS environmental conditions including relative humidity, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and temperature. Within a Veggie chamber, conditions such as humidity and temperature can vary from ISS conditions outside the chamber, for example, the temperature and humidity inside the Veggie tend to be slightly elevated compared to the open cabin air. These differences may have an impact on the elemental, nutritional and microbiological components of the plant. Increased temperatures have been shown to decrease macronutrient content in red leaf lettuce while increasing flavonoids and phenolics (<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">Sublett et al., 2018</xref>). Studies have shown that increased humidity initiates a positive response in biomass yield in many agricultural crops while concomitantly decreasing transpiration rate altering the uptake of water and some nutrients (<xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">Tibbitts, 1979</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gisler&#248;d and Mortensen, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Microbiological testing is an integral part of any food safety program to verify quality, production and proper handling processes but few studies exist for space grown plants (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hummerick et al., 2010</xref>). We conducted microbiological testing of Veggie-grown produce to understand potential risks to astronauts as consumers. Good agricultural practices and procedures are in place to minimize microbial contamination of crops grown in Veggie, and microbial testing is one tool to verify the effectiveness of these processes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Hummerick et al., 2011</xref>). Plant-growth conditions, the surrounding environment, mineral nutrition, and plant species can all influence the microbial populations living on plant surfaces (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lindow and Brandl, 2003</xref>). A variety of microorganisms can be found on fresh produce, most as part of the normal flora of the plant with no adverse effect on humans if consumed (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Heaton and Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Leff and Fierer, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Oyinlola et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Microbiological analysis can also provide insight on the microbial ecology (population density and types of bacteria and fungi) of Veggie-grown plants. The likelihood of contamination and growth of potential human pathogens on plants grown in Veggie is low since sterilization/sanitization of seeds, plant growth medium, irrigation water, and hardware can be controlled. However, if a contamination event were to occur, the risks to the crew of exposure to food borne pathogens could be increased considering the association of immune dysregulation to spaceflight (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Borchers et al., 2002</xref>). Heterotrophic bacterial counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that serve as an indicator of contamination of processed foods, irrigation water, and food processing surfaces are frequently present in raw foods like fresh produce making those tests irrelevant as risk indicators for fruits and vegetables (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Heaton and Jones, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Leff and Fierer, 2013</xref>). The microbial load on crops intended for consumption by astronauts presumably should fall within an acceptable range of microbiological standards set for food. Currently, however, there are no standards in place for microbial levels in fresh produce grown in space. The closest related NASA standards are for non-thermostabilized food items including any of the freeze dried foods consumed in orbit, e.g., shrimp cocktail, chocolate candy, granola bars. For example, the current limit for aerobic bacteria on a non-thermostabilized food item is &lt;2 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) per gram on one sample or &lt;1 &#215; 10<sup>4</sup> on two out of five samples (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Perchonok et al., 2012</xref>) however, these standards apply to prepackaged food sent from Earth. For fresh produce grown on ISS, the microbiological acceptability is assessed on a case-by-case basis relying on microbiological analysis of crops grown in ground studies analogous to Veggie grown crops. Microbiological analysis has been performed previously on edible plants grown in the Russian Lada chamber on ISS (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hummerick et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Mizuna, barley and radish from Lada were stored at &#8722;80&#176;C after harvest until analysis was performed at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. A range of microbial densities as indicated by aerobic bacterial and fungal plate counts was found depending on plant type and location. The four samples of mizuna, the only leafy green tested, were grown in different Lada root modules at different times and counts ranged from 3.1 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup> &#8211; 8.7 &#215; 10<sup>5</sup>. When compared to field grown or market produce of similar types these numbers are well within the expected range of microbial densities or even lower (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Holvoet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#246;hling et al., 2018</xref>; Hummerick et al., unpublished data).</p><p>However, not all microorganisms can be cultured in the laboratory and alternate methods of community characterization are needed (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Byrd et al., 1991</xref>; <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">Schaule et al., 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kalmbach et al., 1997</xref>). Genomic DNA analysis using whole genome or amplicon sequencing provides the capability of identifying 98&#8211;99% of the microbes present in a complex, heterogeneous microbial community. With the current advances in technology, the Illumina MiSeq provided a platform for capturing the community structure of the leaf and root material returned from the ISS and for the ground control samples. Identifying the community makeup is the first step in understanding the complex structure and interactions between mutualistic or symbiotic partners in plant growth systems.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ISS and Veggie environmental conditions on the microbiological and nutritional quality of Veggie grown lettuce intended for crew consumption.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Plant Growth and Harvest</title><p>The Veggie production system on ISS is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, United States) to grow crops in space (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Morrow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Morrow and Remiker, 2009</xref>).

The dominant phyla for all plants, both ground and flight, was Proteobacteria. VEG-03A flight roots had the lowest percent of the Proteobacteria reads at 59% while the corresponding flight leaf sample was 76% of the total bacterial communities. All other plants from VEG-01A and B ranged from 80 to 96% Proteobacterial reads. However, this disparity was not significantly different.

However, it is reasonable to conclude that environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, water levels provided, the microbiota in the air on ISS, and possible human interaction at the time of growth and harvest may contribute to the microbial community and density on the surface of the leaves. Terrestrially, airborne bacteria and fungal spores can land on the surface of leaves and become a part of the epiphytic microbial community albeit transient and dynamic depending on selective pressures (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Lindow and Brandl, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Vokou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Maignien et al., 2014</xref>). Varying conditions such as humidity, leaf surface moisture and temperature can also effect the colonization and growth of bacteria and fungi on leaf surfaces. There is a positive correlation between fungal sporulation and the duration of leaf surface moisture (<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Talley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Poor air circulation can cause persistent droplets of moisture on the surface of a leaf due to transpiration producing a micro environment favorable for microbial proliferation. In the case of the three Veggie plantings on the ISS, environmental data collected by HOBO data recorders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>) showed that temperature and humidity were slightly higher inside the Veggie chamber during the first 22 days of VEG-03A growth than the other two Veggie tests. Additionally, germinating seedlings in the VEG-03A test had excess moisture in the early period of growth, likely due to a fan malfunction, when compared to the VEG-01A and VEG-01B plants. It was during this experiment that our team identified a consistent anomaly with the Veggie hardware &#8211; specifically that when power is cycled to the hardware, upon restarting the fan will read &#8220;low&#8221; but it will actually be off. This problem also led to issues of excess moisture in an earlier Zinnia test but a repetition of this with lettuce confirmed the anomaly. In contrast, VEG-01A and VEG-01B tests had no fan issues, but instead the plants had some periods of low water early on (see <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2017a</xref>). Given that Veggie is a manually watered system and that fluid behavior in microgravity differs considerably from that on Earth, these early Veggie experiments involved considerable variation in fluid addition as both the ground teams and the astronauts struggled to effectively water the crops. Logged data from VEG-03A were not collected for the duration of the 64 days experiment so it is speculative to conclude any correlation between microbial counts and Veggie chamber conditions.</p><p>Key to this work is determining the microbiological food safety of Veggie grown crops. Bacterial and fungal counts on fresh plant material are not necessarily an indication of the food quality and microbiological safety of the item and vary depending on the type of plant (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Leff and Fierer, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Qadri et al., 2015</xref>). Studies show that leafy greens grown in the field or greenhouse have a range of approximately 4&#8211;8 log<sub>10</sub> CFU bacterial counts per gram of sample while yeast and mold counts on lettuce are reported in the range of 2&#8211;5 log<sub>10</sub> (<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Valentin-Bon and Jacobson, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Rastogi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Jackson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Holvoet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Wood et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hagenmair and Baker, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Oyinlola et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Fr&#246;hling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). The microbial counts on lettuce leaves grown on ISS in VEG-01A, B and both harvests from VEG-03A were relatively low on average when compared to farm or market produce counts of similar type. In addition, none of the target human pathogens were detected in culture based testing and 16S community sequencing. These results demonstrate that from a microbiological perspective the Outredgeous variety of lettuce grown in Veggie was safe for human consumption.</p><p>Microbiological data collected from lettuce and reported in the literature provides evidence that different parts of the plant, i.e., leaves and roots support distinct microbial communities (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Ibekwe and Grieve, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">Toju et al., 2019</xref>). While our culture based isolation of bacteria recovered a few species unique to leaves many of the isolates present on the phyllosphere were also present in the roots. Previous work on the relationship of the phyllosphere bacterial community and airborne bacteria by <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Vokou et al. (2012)</xref> demonstrated that colonization of the phyllosphere is not always related to the aerial microbial community within the plants proximity and may include commensal and symbiotic taxa as well as environmentally indigenous transients. <italic toggle="yes">Staphylococcus</italic> has been isolated on the ISS on both surfaces and in the air (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Venkateswaran et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) so it is not unlikely that plants in Veggie chambers would be exposed to these types of bacteria. Microbiological surveys done on a variety of surfaces and materials on the ISS reported many of the same bacteria and fungi that we isolated from plant material grown in Veggie. We compared bacterial and fungal isolates from this study of Veggie grown plants with isolates described in a study by <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Venkateswaran et al. (2017)</xref> which characterized the microbiology of ISS surfaces. More than 50% of the genera of bacteria and 100% of the fungi isolated and identified on ISS surfaces were also isolated from Veggie samples.</p><p>NASA reported monitoring results of space station samples including air surfaces and water from 1998 to 2012 using cultivation methods (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">Yamaguchi et al., 2014</xref>). In these studies, the two most commonly isolated genera from water samples collected between 2009 and 2012 were <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia</italic> sp. and <italic toggle="yes">Ralstonia</italic> sp. These are persistent and common in station potable water as well as terrestrial water sources and have been isolated and identified from Space Shuttle potable water (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Koenig and Pierson, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>) so it is not unexpected that these were also isolated in the roots and leaves of both flight and ground control plants.</p><p>Plants, regardless of growth conditions, harbor an indigenous population that may affect plant health and, if utilized as a food source, human health. One of the important findings in this study is the similarity and densities in the dominant leaf and root microbial community members as those reported in the literature grown under very different conditions (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Dees et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Culturable microbes include approximately 10% of the community microbial participants. Research on core rhizosphere and phyllosphere associated bacterial microbiota (symbiotic and pathogenic) have been described using culture-independent sequencing methods (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019</xref>). Next generation sequencing provides an alternative method to identify non-culturable microorganisms. It is important to identify these organisms as it may provide insight into the safety and health quality of the plants/crops being harvested and consumed. Each of the bacterial and fungal isolates identified in this study were confirmed with sequencing results, however, many additional genera were identified. Research studies indicate Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria phyla dominate communities, though differences may occur between host plant species at lower taxonomic levels (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019</xref>). Sequencing data from the three Veggie experiments followed these trends.</p><p>Lettuce leaf tissue in all three Veggie experiments was dominated with <italic toggle="yes">Thermogemmatispora</italic>, a gram positive, sporulating, soil organism that has been known to produce secondary metabolites provided to plants as a secondary resource (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Komaki et al., 2016</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Thermogemmatispora</italic> has been found in lettuce seeds in high abundance but was reduced in root and leaf tissues (unpublished data, Khodadad et al). <italic toggle="yes">Bradyrhizobium</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Mesorhizobium</italic> are also commonly found in soils as they may participate in nitrogen fixation (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Okubo et al., 2012</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">Bradyrhizobium</italic> has also been noted in higher abundance in low nutrient soils (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Okubo et al., 2012</xref>). Both microbes were present in higher abundance in flight root samples and were low or undetectable in leaf tissue with the highest abundance in VEG-03A roots. VEG-03A was grown for longer periods of time and may have depleted the nutrient levels in the substrate. In addition, microbes commonly associated with water were also detected in both leaf and root tissue. These microbes mentioned previously include <italic toggle="yes">Ralstonia</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Cupriavidus</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas</italic> were identified in all leaf and root samples of all three Veggie experiments. These have been identified as present on ISS as well as in the ISS water system (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Castro et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Checinska et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">Venkateswaran et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that several of the microbes identified may be potential endosymbionts with plants or fungi and be present as epiphytic or endophytic organisms. One example is <italic toggle="yes">Chitinophaga</italic>, found in all flight and ground root samples. Though it is unknown what the function of this bacteria may have been within these Veggie communities, it has been found to interact with fungal species present in plants by enhancing nutrient uptake and growth, altering plant water interactions or deterring potential pathogens (<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>). These interactions have the capability of shaping plant health and productivity by accessing and making additional carbon sources available (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kivlin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>). To determine their role and benefit to plants or fungi would require additional flight and ground studies. As fungi were present in each flight and ground sample community, it is important to note those in abundance and their persistence over time. Fungi have been detected on the ISS in various locations (<xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">Venkateswaran et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Leaf and root systems of VEG-01A and B were surveyed for the presence of fungi and compared. <italic toggle="yes">Alternaria, Microidium</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Phaeoacremonium</italic> were the top three fungal genera identified with sequencing. <italic toggle="yes">Alternaria</italic>, an Ascomycota, has been described as a saprophyte that may decompose organic matter, and increase in communities with high humidity (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Patriarca, 2016</xref>). They may also associate with other fungal genera such as <italic toggle="yes">Fusarium</italic> or <italic toggle="yes">Stachybotrys</italic>. Though neither of these fungal genera were identified in VEG-01A, both were first detected in VEG-01B samples with higher incidence in ground samples therefore, they may have been introduced as a contaminant. <italic toggle="yes">Phaeoacremonium</italic> is a plant associated endophyte previously associated with lettuce and woody plants (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Mostert et al., 2005</xref>) while <italic toggle="yes">Microidium</italic> may be an opportunistic plant pathogen especially in high humidity environments (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Braun and Cook, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Plants require macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo) for their growth and development (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Epstein, 1972</xref>). These elements are essential and play critical roles in multiple plant processes. Comparing all three experiments, VEG-01B had higher elemental contents for Na, P, S, and Zn, whereas VEG-03A had the lowest amounts for Fe and K. Considering the chronological order of the experiments onboard the ISS, VEG-01B was grown a year later than VEG-01A, which raises the possibility of a change in the ISS water, but that may not be the only variable as plants grown in microgravity experience stresses from environmental conditions, so it would be impractical to draw any conclusions from these differences. VEG-03A, which was grown 1.5 years after the VEG-01B, was the sequential harvest experiment. As described in section &#8220;Materials and Methods,&#8221; there were four repeated harvests (38, 45, 59, and 64 days after initiation) of this experiment and only two (day 45 and day 64) were returned to earth. Romaine lettuce in field settings can take 75 days to fully mature, however, controlled environment growth is generally faster. By the final harvest photos indicated that some of the plants seemed to be transitioning to a reproductive growth phase, so it is possible that stresses from space flight may have pushed the plants to initiate senescence and that could provide a possible explanation for slightly lower elemental levels of some elements in VEG-03A samples (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Maillard et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, differences in the levels of total phenolics among VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A samples could be attributed to the environmental conditions. There have been known challenges associated with irrigation of plants in the Veggie hardware and VEG-01 showed evidence of insufficient and excess (in case of zinnia, VEG-01C) water in the root zone (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Massa et al., 2017a</xref>). Studies have shown that either insufficient watering (drought-like, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Sarker and Oba, 2018</xref>) or over-watering leading to hypoxia (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Rajapakse et al., 2009</xref>) can induce production of phenolic compounds and free-radical scavenging activities. Again, there are not enough data to make any conclusions about the effects of the sequential harvesting method on plant ionome or phenolic content and more robust experiments are needed.</p><p>Numerous Veggie tests have been conducted on the ISS, the plant growth evaluated, and in some cases the leaves consumed. Three plantings of red romaine lettuce were considered here (VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A). Through culturable and non-culturable methods of microbial analysis, the Veggie tests demonstrated diverse microbial communities with no potential human pathogens detected and therefore could provide a safe supplement to the astronauts&#8217; diet. Chemical analysis provided evidence of significant changes in elemental and antioxidant content which may be an important factor to consider for nutritional value in future, long duration, exploration missions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study can be found in GeneLab accessions: VEG01A: GLDS-267, VEG01B: GLDS-268, and VEG03A: GLDS-269.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>GM, RW, MR, and TS contributed to the design of the work with MH, LS, JR, and CK completing research and data analysis.
