As a result, the air above the epicentral region of an impending major earthquake often becomes laden with positive airborne ions. Medical research has long shown that positive airborne ions cause changes in stress hormone levels in animals and humans. In addition to the ULF/ELF emissions, positive airborne ions can cause unusual reactions among animals. When the charge carriers flow into water, they oxidize water to hydrogen peroxide. This, plus oxidation of organic compounds, can cause behavioral changes among aquatic animals.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pre-earthquake phenomena</kwd><kwd>positive holes</kwd><kwd>ULF (ultralow frequency) waves</kwd><kwd>ELF (extremely low frequency) waves</kwd><kwd>air ionization</kwd><kwd>water oxidation</kwd><kwd>hydrogen peroxide</kwd><kwd>physiological effects</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Earthquakes are caused by the build-up of tectonic stresses. When rocks reach a critical limit, catastrophic failure occurs, causing a rupture to propagate, sometimes over distances of hundreds of kilometers, with typical speeds in the range of 2.2&#8211;3 km/s&#8212;supersonic with respect to the speed of sound in air. The rupture generates shockwaves in the Earth that spread at speeds of about 6 km/s for the compressional (P) waves and about 3.4 km/s for the more destructive shear (S) waves. An earthquake of magnitude 7 releases an energy equivalent to that of more than 2000 Hiroshima-class atomic bombs. The magnitude scale being exponential, the energy released by a magnitude 9 earthquake is equivalent to more than 2,000,000 A-bombs. </p><p>Mainstream seismology, as currently practiced, focuses on understanding earthquakes from a mechanistic viewpoint using information collected by the analysis of past earthquakes to predict future earthquakes [<xref rid="B1-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, even if the database for past events is very large, counting thousands, even tens of thousands, the prediction of any single future earthquake is subject to the large uncertainty, which is an inescapable corollary of statistics of small numbers. For this reason seismological prediction models are typically given with uncertainty windows on the order of decades, even centuries. Only in very few cases have predictions been attempted with quoted uncertainty windows of only a few years [<xref rid="B3-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Seismologists are of course aware of these statistical limitations. This is why their majority believes that earthquakes are inherently unpredictable [<xref rid="B5-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. </p><p>In view of the enormously large amounts of mechanical energy released by major seismic events, however, it is inconceivable&#8212;from a physics perspective&#8212;that the Earth would not produce some identifiable non-seismic and non-mechanical signals prior to such large-scale catastrophic events. Whether or not, and to what extent, the precursory signals are reliable is another question.</p><p>There have been countless accounts of precursory signals, too many to list here. They span a bewildering diversity of phenomena ranging from stories of unusual animal behavior on land, in the air and in the water, to the emission of electromagnetic radiation over many orders of frequency space, to distinct changes in the electron distribution at the lower edge of the ionosphere some 100&#8211;300 km above the surface of the Earth, and many others. </p><p>The problem facing earthquake forecasting is not that there has been a lack of reported pre-earthquake (pre-EQ) phenomena. The real problem lies in the lack of understanding what the different types of reported pre-EQ phenomena mean and how they might be generated. </p><p>There have also been countless attempts to interpret pre-EQ signals and to assign them to known physical processes that could occur in the Earth crust in response to the build-up of tectonic stresses. The problem is that the reported pre-EQ phenomena are so diverse and fall into the competency range of so many different scientific disciplines that it has not been possible, so far, to reach any consensus.</p><p>If such a situation arises, namely that scientists from different disciplines cannot agree on a scientific explanation of a set of naturally occurring phenomena such as pre-EQ phenomena, chances are that the physical underpinning of the processes in the Earth crust during the build-up of tectonic stresses are not yet properly understood. This is particularly relevant to the contentious issue of unusual pre-EQ animal behavior reported in the scientific and non-scientific literature. </p><sec><title>1.1. Setting the Stage</title><p>Earthquakes are usually reported in terms of the location of their epicenter, their magnitude, and their depth. The hypocenter is defined as the point at depth, where the rupture starts. The epicenter is the point on the Earth surface straight above the hypocenter. </p><p>Most major crustal earthquakes occur in the 7&#8211;35 km depth range. At this depth the isostatic overload is substantial, ranging from about 2,000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> to 10,000 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>, 2&#8211;10 metric tons on every square centimeter. Under these conditions it is highly questionable whether two processes, which are widely quoted in the context of pre-EQ signals, can in fact take place: (i) microfracturing and (ii) the electrokinetic effect. </p><p>Microfracturing had been introduced in the late 1960s as part of the &#8220;Dilatancy theory&#8221; [<xref rid="B7-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which started with the observation that, when rock cylinders are uniaxially stressed, they bulge out and that their total volume increases [<xref rid="B9-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In unconstrained rock cylinders such volume increase is due to internal cracks opening as a result of the applied stress. However, deep in the Earth crust, under the isostatic load of tens of kilometers of rock, the opening of cracks or microfractures is unlikely because the attendant volume increase has to perform work against a very large overload.</p><p>Rocks in the upper reaches of the Earth crust, from zero to about 5&#8211;7 km, have non-zero porosity. The pores are water-filled or brine-filled. They often communicate, allowing the fluids to flow along stress gradients. Such fluid flow leads to separation of charges because cations tend to be retained on the walls of pores and narrow channels, while anions are carried along with the flow. This is the electrokinetic effect. The resulting potential, the &#8220;streaming potential&#8221;, produces voltage signals, which have been invoked to explain geoelectric and electromagnetic signals recorded prior to major earthquakes [<xref rid="B13-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, streaming potentials can only be produced in the most shallow crust, where rocks are porous but where earthquakes do not typically occur. </p><p>Nonetheless microfracturing and the electrokinetic effect have been invoked in the context of unusual pre-EQ animal behavior. </p><p>A third process frequently quoted in the context of pre-EQ phenomena is emanation of radon gas from the ground. Radioactive <sup>222</sup>Rn, which has a half-life of 2.8 days and decays via emission of a 507 MeV alpha particle into polonium <sup>218</sup>Po, is a product of the uranium-radium decay chain. Changes in pre-EQ radon emanation have long been reported [<xref rid="B17-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Each alpha particle emitted during radon decay creates about 10<sup>5</sup> electron-ion pairs along its path, forming a narrow plasma channel, about 1 cm long in air. A small fraction of these electron-ion pairs escape recombination and, hence, lead to an increase in air conductivity. This air conductivity increase has been claimed to be responsible for a number of pre-EQ phenomena including animal behavior [<xref rid="B20-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The idea is that, if changes in radon emanation are due to microfracturing, animals might possess unusual capabilities to detect the faint vibrations from microfracturing in the near-surface environment. </p><p>Much of what has been said and written about pre-EQ phenomena can be traced back to the seismology and its reliance on mechanical concepts. </p><p>Microfracturing, for instance, is based on the assumption that pre-EQ stresses can be transmitted laterally from the hypocenter over long distances defined as &#8220;earthquake preparation zone&#8221; where the radius r is given by the relation r = 10<sup>0.43M</sup>, M the magnitude and r the distance in kilometers [<xref rid="B21-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. For a magnitude 7 earthquake r would be 1,000 km. Such large EQ preparation zones and the assumed lateral stress transfer are inconsistent with other reports that pre-EQ stress changes are seldom detected, even with most sensitive strain gauges [<xref rid="B22-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The electrokinetic effect is likewise based on mechanical concepts, namely that stress gradients provide the driving force for fluid flow through porous rocks, which in turn would generate electric signals. Fluctuations in the flow rate are then expected to lead to low frequency electromagnetic emissions [<xref rid="B14-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p><p>Many other attempts to find explanations for reported pre-EQ phenomena also rely on mechanical concepts inherited from seismology.</p></sec><sec><title>1.2. Shifting Paradigm</title><p>Largely unnoticed by the mainstream geoscience community, work over the past 3&#189; decades has led to crucial insight into non-seismic pre-EQ signals. The original goal of this work was to characterize inconspicuous defects in minerals: pairs of oxygen anions that have changed their valence from the common oxidation state 2- to the more oxidized state 1-. These so-called peroxy defects occur in the matrix of silicate minerals in igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks&#8212;rocks that form the bulk of the Earth&#8217;s crust over the seismogenic depth range [<xref rid="B27-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p><p>Examples of peroxy defects are O<sub>3</sub>Si-OO-SiO<sub>3</sub> bonds replacing Si-O-Si bonds in mineral structures. The peroxy bonds are introduced through the dissolution of small amounts of &#8220;water&#8221; into minerals that crystallize from magma or recrystallize in deep high-temperature environments. The H<sub>2</sub>O molecules that enter into the solid state turn into &#8220;impurity&#8221; hydroxyls, O<sub>3</sub>Si-OH:
<disp-formula>O<sub>3</sub>Si-O-SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O &#11012; O<sub>3</sub>Si-OH HO-SiO<sub>3</sub><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p><p>Upon cooling, when diffusional processes freeze and thermodynamic equilibrium can no longer be maintained, the O<sub>3</sub>Si-OH pairs undergo a redox conversion:
<disp-formula>O<sub>3</sub>Si-OH HO-SiO<sub>3</sub> &#11012; O<sub>3</sub>Si-OO-SiO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p><p>This is a classical redox conversion, unusual only in the sense that the electron transfer involves hydroxyl oxygens donating an electron to their protons, reducing them to H. Two H combine to H<sub>2</sub>, while the oxygens, now oxidized to the valence state 1-, combine to form peroxy. </p><p>The O<sup>&#8722;</sup>&#8211;O<sup>&#8722;</sup> bond in O<sub>3</sub>Si-OO-SiO<sub>3</sub> is very short, only 1.5 &#197;, about half the distance between normal neighboring O<sup>2&#8722;</sup> anions. The shortness makes the peroxy bonds susceptible to the perturbations such as the slightest sliding of mineral grains during the build-up of stress, causing O<sub>3</sub>Si-OO-SiO<sub>3</sub> bonds to break. The broken peroxy bonds split off electronic charge carriers, chemically O<sup>&#8722;</sup> in a matrix of O<sup>2&#8722;</sup>, physically defect electrons in the O<sup>2&#8722;</sup> sublattice, known as positive holes and symbolized by h<sup>&#8226;</sup>.</p><p>The h<sup>&#8226;</sup> are highly mobile and have the capability to flow out of the stressed rock volume deep in the Earth crust, where a rock rupture may soon occur. The h<sup>&#8226;</sup> flow out into the surrounding rocks. They travel fast and far, tens of kilometers, possibly hundreds of kilometers prior to large earthquakes. They form electric currents in the Earth crust, sometimes hundreds of thousands of amperes strong [<xref rid="B29-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. When these currents fluctuate, they emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. The ultralow frequency (ULF) components of these EM waves can be transmitted through tens of kilometers of rocks and detected at the Earth surface. Likewise the attenuation of ULF and ELF waves through ocean water is weak. Hence, the effects discussed here would also apply to cases where earthquakes occur offshore. </p><p>When h<sup>&#8226;</sup> charge carriers arrive at the Earth surface or cross from the solid Earth into water, they cause a variety of reactions, physical and chemical. How these reactions express themselves in the surface environment is of interest in the context of animal response and the topic of this report. </p></sec></sec><sec><title>2. Pre-Earthquake Processes and the Biosphere</title><p>Reports on unusual animal behavior before major earthquakes are innumerable, some dating back to antiquity. Because so little is known about the nature of the physical or chemical clues to which animals appear to respond, there is a strong tendency in some scientific circles to dismiss the reports and call them &#8220;anecdotal&#8221;. However, if similar observations, often strikingly similar, have been reported across centuries by people living on different continents, in different seismically active regions, a reasonable argument can be made that these reports are not just &#8220;anecdotal&#8221;. Since they are validated by multiple independent observations, they suggest the presence of physical and/or chemical stimuli in the environment, to which animals respond. For moderate to large earthquakes the Earth appears to produce these stimuli within a time window of about two weeks to one day, sometimes only a few hours, before the event. For magnitude 9-class earthquakes the time window could be wider. </p><sec><title>2.1. The Effect of Electromagnetic Waves on Organismal Physiology</title><p>Exposure to electromagnetic waves can have physiological effects on a wide variety of organisms [<xref rid="B30-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Importantly, the physiological effects can be induced by exposure to the level of EM energy in the thermal noise, which helps to explain the challenge in analytical detection of earthquake precursors in the EM spectrum. For example, one of the most astonishing effects of extremely low amplitude EM oscillating field, even when the magnetic flux of such field is below the thermal noise (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, nanoTesla field), is to change the electron precession, or spin, in universally conserved biochemical reactions that coordinate genome expression to maintain circadian timing. The cryptochrome proteins, which maintain the circadian rhythm, also show high sequence similarity to universally conserved proteins that maintain genome integrity by repair of oxidation-damaged DNA [<xref rid="B31-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Such weak EM fields tuned in frequency to the rate of electron spin (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, MHz) have been shown to cause aberrant growth of cells and disorientation with respect to the magnetic and gravity vectors in various organisms, including plants and animals [<xref rid="B32-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Therefore, the universal time-setting basis of invariant biochemical reactions can be an EM field in the thermal noise.</p><p>Additionally, there have been many studies over several decades reporting on significant physical, biological and health-related effects associated with changes in solar and geomagnetic activity. The changes in solar and geomagnetic activity lead to changes in the ambient extremely low frequency (ELF) and the ultralow frequency (ULF) field at the Earth surface, specifically to the immersion of the Earth surface environment into broadband EM field (0.1&#8211;50 Hz), which can be the causal link between these changes in the ambient ELF field, both under pre-earthquake conditions and during geomagnetic storms [<xref rid="B33-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and the various effects noted in the biosphere.</p><p>However, despite decades of research in characterizing the effects of non-ionizing EM radiation on organismal physiology, including in humans, the results often seem to be inconsistent or difficult to interpret. For example, some experimental studies claim a direct effect of ELF on metabolism [<xref rid="B30-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while theoretical studies dispute the possibility of such effects based on first principles [<xref rid="B34-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, the international guidelines for limiting exposure to time-varying electric and magnetic fields in the low-frequency range consider ULF and ELF EM fields to be biologically relevant only, if their amplitudes exceed the ambient field of about 40 pT by at least 10<sup>9</sup> times (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, in excess of 0.01 T magnetic flux density) [<xref rid="B35-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. How can this discrepancy in empirical evidence be reconciled without dismissing the potential importance of modulating organismal physiology with EM fields, while remaining in accord with physical principles? </p><p>It is important to recognize that EM waves are time-dependent phenomena and their effects on temporally organized biochemical cycles in living cells, such as the reduction oxidation cycle, can generate quite opposite effects depending upon their phase relationships. The redox cycle, also called the metabolic cycle, is the fundamental biochemical process that controls the timing of all biochemical reactions in living cells, including energy production, RNA transcription, and DNA replication. Through temporal coordination a chemical conflict between the reductive and oxidative reactions is avoided, while at the same time a coherent or interfering transfer of energy is enabled between the ambient natural electromagnetic (EM) field and living cells. The interaction between EM waves and electron transport in redox reactions clearly depends on the phase relationship between oscillating systems. </p><p>Therefore, whether or not ambient non-ionizing EM fields are able to affect biological processes in organisms can be very sensitive to resonance, which occurs when the organismal physiology is able to transfer energy from ambient EM field in tune with the electromotive force across membranes. An appropriate experimental approach to reconcile the inconsistencies in the effects of EM field on organismal physiology is to identify the point of resonance between the time-setting basis of ambient EM waves in the environment and the phase of the biochemical reduction oxidation cycle in the electron transport chain (ETC) <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. </p><p>Clearly, animals including birds and turtles can detect the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, and use the field to navigate during migration [<xref rid="B36-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. For example, the Bar-tailed Godwit bird has one of the longest non-stop migrations of any species, up to 10,200 km (6,300 mi). Magnetic perception can also account for the behavior of cows and wild deer that tend to align their bodies north-south direction while relaxing, but not when the animals are under high voltage power lines that generate ELF electromagnetic fields, which disrupt the magnetic alignment of ruminants [<xref rid="B37-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although the geomagnetic field is weak and is generally thought to be masked by thermal fluctuations and other noise, the proposed bio-physical mechanism for magneto perception is based on coherent quantum effects of extremely weak magnetic fields on the electron spin in each of radical pair intermediates of molecules in redox reactions [<xref rid="B32-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Depending on the electron spin state, different reaction products are produced, and at different rates. The switch between the products of the redox reactions is shifted by the ambient EM field, which can affect the organismal behavior [<xref rid="B32-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. </p><p>These results indicate that the rates and direction of electron transfer reactions&#8212;the rate at which an electron can move or jump from one chemical species (called the electron donor) to another (called the electron acceptor)&#8212;are subject to ambient EM field influences. This process of electron transport <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> is fundamental to all organisms because it is biochemically coupled with the transfer of H<sup>+</sup> ions (protons) across a membrane. The resulting electrochemical proton gradient is used to generate chemical energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (<italic toggle="yes">ATP</italic>). Importantly, the universal ETC is made from components (such as iron oxides, e.g., heme) with a strong magnetic moment that increases the effect of the weak ambient EM field [<xref rid="B32-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. </p><p>Intriguingly, the rotation frequency of the molecular enzyme motor called ATP synthase, which synthesizes ATP also oscillates at ELF (10&#8211;70 Hz) [<xref rid="B39-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Consequently, thermodynamic coupling by EM resonance is possible between the ambient EM field and the most fundamental biochemical process of life. Although the energy and geometric scale of external EM waves and the energy and dimensions of the ATP synthase enzyme motor differ by at least 12 orders of magnitude, it is to be noted that, due to quantum mechanical delocalization of electronic wave functions, the ATP synthase has the capability to extract EM energy from a volume much larger than the volume, which itself occupies [<xref rid="B40-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. This astonishing physical phenomenon allows the systems to exceed&#8212;through athermal mechanisms&#8212;the limit on EM radiation with intensity less than 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> thought to be unlikely to significantly affect physiology. In addition, it is important to note that pausing the rotation of ATP synthase, or changing the direction of its rotation, leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to the depletion of ATP, respectively. Both biochemical events result in metabolic stress <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (e.g., oxidative stress) that can conceivably account for anomalous animal behavior.</p><p>Therefore, organisms are likely able to detect earthquake-induced variations in the ambient EM field because EM perturbations can affect the time-setting physical basis for the known <italic toggle="yes">universal</italic> biochemical order in living cells [<xref rid="B42-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. </p></sec><sec><title>2.2.

The h<sup>&#8226;</sup> become trapped at the surface, forming a subsurface charge layer of thickness d, where d is typically only a few ten nanometers.

If the voltage V reaches, say, 3 V, and the thickness becomes 6 nm, the E field will reach values on the order of 50,000,000 V/cm. This is enough to accelerate electrons in the air, which are always present due to cosmic ray and other ionization events, to such high values that they begin to impact-ionize neutral air molecules, triggering tiny corona discharges. Importantly these corona discharges produce avalanches of electrons and positive ions in the air. The free electrons will attach themselves rapidly to neutral air molecules such as N<sub>2</sub>, forming negative airborne ions such as N<sub>2</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>.

The radium isotope <sup>226</sup>Ra decays by alpha particle emission to <sup>222</sup>Ra, which itself is radioactive, decaying through the emission of 507 MeV alpha particles to the polonium isotope <sup>218</sup>Po [<xref rid="B62-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. <sup>222</sup>Ra has a half-life of 2.8 days. </p><p>Radon is a noble gas and widely thought to be chemically inert, released from the ground only because, prior to major earthquakes, microfracturing is supposed to occur in the near-surface underground. This is the usual mechanical concept inherited from seismology, where cracks are believed to open in the rocks, releasing gases. However, because radon is the heaviest of the noble gases, it must be chemically reactive, even more so than xenon, forming compounds with soil organics. Therefore, on its diffusion path from below to the surface through the overlying soil, radon atoms are expected to be retained due to chemisorption to soil organics. The most likely retention sites would be triple-bonded carbon compounds in the soil, forming R-Rn-C&#8801;C-H (with R being -CH<sub>3</sub>

The radon atoms would then be free to continue their diffusional path to the surface, where they enter the air space.</p><p>It is true that, besides cosmic rays, radon decay in the near-surface air is the main source of the ambient air ionization accounting for about 200 ion pairs per cm<sup>3</sup> air at sea level [<xref rid="B65-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>].

The total amount of CO in the air column would be enough to reach 500 ppm near the surface, a potentially lethal concentration because CO induces phase advancement into the oxidative respiratory phase of the metabolic cycle in all aerobic organisms. Indeed, CO acts in a manner similar to cyanide by binding to the heme in cytochrome c oxidase and inhibits electron transport and ATP production, which leads to an increased ROS production.

This prevailing attitude makes it difficult, if not impossible, to recognize the complexity of the interactions between animals and the physical world. The real problem is not the absence of observationally well-documented facts about unusual animal behavior but a lack of understanding how the reported non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena are generated in the natural environments, and what are the non-seismic stimuli to which animals appear to respond. </p><p>The discovery of positive hole charge carriers, h<sup>&#8226;</sup>, has led to insights into the physical processes that occur deep in the Earth crust during the build-up of high levels of stress and into the range of unusual properties that seem to be characteristic of these previously unrecognized electronic charge carriers in rocks [<xref rid="B28-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p><p>The purpose of our paper is to draw attention to the fact that, during build-up of stresses&#8212;but before catastrophic rupture&#8212;an activation of h<sup>&#8226;</sup> charge carriers takes place in rocks that form the deeper layers of the Earth crust. This is a non-seismic process that takes place during every episode of waxing stress in the Earth crust regardless of whether or not the rocks will rupture catastrophically. Stress-activation of h<sup>&#8226;</sup> charge carriers, a quintessential pre-EQ phenomenon, is essential to all non-seismic pre-EQ phenomena mentioned in this paper.</p><p>As highly mobile electronic charge carriers, the h<sup>&#8226;</sup> have the ability to spread out of the stressed rock volume into the surrounding less stressed or unstressed rocks. They can travel fast and far. During their propagation through the Earth crust they can generate ULF and ELF electromagnetic radiation. Upon arrival at the ground-to-air interface they can cause air ionization and corona discharges. Upon arrival at the ground-to-water interface they can act as highly oxidizing &#8226;O radicals and oxidize H<sub>2</sub>O to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Through coupling to the electron transport chain <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>, by modulating the electron transport along the ETC, ULF and ELF waves can transfer energy, which exceeds the buffering capacity against free radicals and thereby cause oxidative stress in living organisms [<xref rid="B76-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. It was shown that, consistently, some ubiquitous environmental factors feedback directly on heredity through the ETC in organisms by leaking electrons that result in oxidative damage and genome sequence variation (<italic toggle="yes">i.e.</italic>, non-random mutation) between generations [<xref rid="B67-animals-03-00513" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. </p><p>Animals can clearly respond to a range of different physical and chemical stimuli arising directly or indirectly from the stress-activation of h<sup>&#8226;</sup> charge carriers. Indeed, understanding the nature of these enigmatic the electronic charge carriers in rocks provides insight, which was previously not unavailable, into the modulation of redox states in the Earth&#8217;s ecosystems from the global scale down to the atomic level.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Conclusions</title><p>A previously unknown or overlooked physical process takes place in rocks that are subjected to large stresses deep below in the Earth crust before major earthquakes. This process leads to the activation of electronic charge carriers, which can spread out of the stressed rock volume into the surrounding rocks, traveling fast and far. They generate electromagnetic waves, of which the ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) portion can be transmitted through rocks. The ULF and ELF waves have the capacity to interact with living organisms and to interfere with fundamental biochemical reactions at the cellular level. When the charge carriers arrive at the ground-to-air interface, they are able to ionize the air producing&#8212;under certain conditions&#8212;exclusively positive airborne ions. Such positive airborne ions are known to have pronounced and generally detrimental physiological effects. When these charge carriers arrive at the water-to-air interface, they oxidize the water and possibly organic compounds dissolved in the water, producing potentially hazardous toxins. Understanding the complex sequence of events taking place in the Earth crust during the lead-up to major earthquakes provides insight into the causes of unusual pre-earthquake animal behavior. </p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by NASA grants to Friedemann Freund from the NASA Earth Surface and Interior (ESI) Program (NNX12AL71G through the San Jose State University Research Foundation) and from the NASA Exobiology Program (NNX10AR81G through the SETI Institute).
