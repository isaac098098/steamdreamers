Further research, however, is needed to characterize and address the molecular substrates of such changes. For this reason, neonatal and adult human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) were cultured aboard the International Space Station. Upon return to Earth, we measured changes in the expression of microRNAs and of genes related to mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. We additionally assessed endothelial-like tube formation, cell cycling, and migratory capacity of CPCs. Changes in microRNA expression were predicted to target extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling in both neonatal and adult CPCs. Genes related to mechanotransduction (<italic toggle="yes">YAP1, RHOA</italic>) were downregulated, while the expression of cytoskeletal genes (<italic toggle="yes">VIM</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">NES</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">DES</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LMNB2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">LMNA</italic>), non-canonical Wnt ligands (<italic toggle="yes">WNT5A</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">WNT9A</italic>), and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules (<italic toggle="yes">PLCG1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">PRKCA</italic>) was significantly elevated in neonatal CPCs. Increased mesendodermal gene expression along with decreased expression of mesodermal derivative markers (<italic toggle="yes">TNNT2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">VWF</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">RUNX2</italic>), reduced readiness to form endothelial-like tubes, and elevated expression of Bmp and Tbx genes, were observed in neonatal CPCs. Both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited increased expression of DNA repair genes and paracrine factors, which was supported by enhanced migration. While spaceflight affects cytoskeletal organization and migration in neonatal and adult CPCs, only neonatal CPCs experienced increased expression of early developmental markers and an enhanced proliferative potential. Efforts to recapitulate the effects of spaceflight on Earth by regulating processes described herein may be a promising avenue for cardiac repair.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Stem cells: Spaceflight changes nature of heart progenitors</title><p id="Par2">Spaceflight alters the developmental status, proliferative potential and migratory ability of heart stem cells. Mary Kearns-Jonker from &#8232;Loma Linda University, California, USA, and colleagues characterized the molecular expression profiles of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) obtained from neonatal and adult patients and then cultured them aboard the International Space Station for 12 days. They found that spaceflight impacted the expression of microRNAs and genes related to cell cycling, DNA repair and important signaling events in both populations of CPCs, but there were some important differences. Of note, only neonatal CPCs showed enhanced potential for certain regenerative processes following spaceflight. Understanding the molecular basis for the beneficial effects induced in neonatal CPCs by spaceflight and mimicking these effects on Earth may boost the therapeutic efficacy of cell-based therapies.

In doing so, researchers have begun to identify therapeutic benefits, such as enhanced stemness, following culture in space and under conditions that approximate weightlessness on Earth. Therefore, increased understanding of the response of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) to spaceflight may not only benefit human health in space, but also provide insights into novel cardiovascular stem cell therapies that can be applied on Earth.</p><p id="Par4">Recent research in our own laboratory has shown that neonatal human CPCs cultured under two-dimensional (2D) clinorotation, which approximates weightlessness by rotating the cell culture vessel about a horizontal axis, exhibit increased expression of markers of early cardiovascular development and pluripotency (i.e., <italic toggle="yes">MESP1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">T</italic> (Brachyury), and <italic toggle="yes">OCT4</italic>) as well as broad changes to microRNA expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> The changes in microRNA expression experienced by CPCs in these experiments mirrored the expression of similar microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) under normal conditions of early cardiovascular development, thereby suggesting that such culture conditions induce an epigenetic environment that favors an earlier development status. Such a state appears increasingly beneficial for cardiovascular repair. For example, the efficacy of multipotent stem cells expressing Isl1<sup>+</sup> and SSEA-1<sup>+</sup> in ameliorating the symptoms of severe heart failure was recently demonstrated in one patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Furthermore, KEGG analysis indicated that the microRNAs downregulated in CPCs in these experiments target several signaling pathways, such as MAPK and Wnt, which are relevant to well-characterized repair mechanisms or cardiac stem cell proliferation mechanisms in the heart. For example, non-canonical Wnt ligands (i.e., Wnt2b, Wnt5a, and Wnt9a) have been shown to be associated with the injury response in neonatal rodent heart tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Therefore, our observations suggest that 2D clinorotation may foster a developmental state and signaling events that could enhance the use of CPCs for cardiovascular repair. This is supported by one recent study by Jha et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, which demonstrated that human induced pluripotent stem cells more readily differentiate into cardiomyocytes following three-dimensional (3D) (i.e., embryoid) culture under the influence of a random positioning machine. In the context of our previous findings, these experiments may highlight a potential phenomenon in which 2D clinorotation promotes an enhanced state of stemness that results in increased differentiation potential when the cells are returned to normal gravity conditions.</p><p id="Par5">It is currently believed that small RhoGTPases act as transducers of the mechanical alterations that are observed under conditions of spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> As actors in the planar cell polarity Wnt pathway, they have central roles in cytoskeletal remodeling. Along with the Hippo pathway and calcium signaling, small RhoGTPases represent one potential molecular substrate of gravity sensing. Notably, in the context of cardiogenesis, these processes are central to maintaining multipotency or directing differentiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> Despite the early reports of the effects of spaceflight on stem cells, much is unknown about the mechanisms by which CPCs respond to spaceflight or how these cell types develop enhanced stemness. Hence, we are not yet able to leverage the therapeutic potential of spaceflight here on Earth. While current clinical trials to stimulate repair in damaged heart tissue are promising,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> they are stymied by a failure of cells to engraft into the host tissue and by the use of progenitor types that are restricted in potency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, identifying the molecular events that promote enhanced stemness and regenerative potential in CPCs during spaceflight will benefit stem cell-based cardiac repair.</p><p id="Par6">The successful use of autologous CPC sources to regenerate heart tissue in a predominately adult population requires additional understanding of the differences between adult and neonatal CPCs. Our laboratory has previously documented differences in age-dependent expression of microRNAs related to MAPK signaling, cytoskeleton regulation, adherens junction expression, and focal adhesion maintenance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> The relationship between these processes and the age-dependent response of CPCs to spaceflight remain unknown, but they imply deficits in the intracellular transduction of environmental cues in the functional shortcomings of adult CPCs.</p><p id="Par7">Therefore, in this study, clonal lines of neonatal and adult human CPCs were cultured aboard the ISS. We sought to identify changes in these CPCs in response to spaceflight that impact signaling, development, and stemness. We then characterized the divergent response of neonatal and adult CPCs to spaceflight. In doing so, we present components of the adaptive cellular response to culture aboard the ISS and their implications for enhancing the regenerative potential of neonatal and adult CPCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CPCs exhibit markers of early cardiovascular development</title><p id="Par8">CPCs were clonally isolated, expanded, screened for the co-expression of Isl1 and c-Kit, assessed for viability, and ultimately selected for experiments based upon the expression of early developmental markers (Mesp1, PDGFR&#945;, and SSEA1) along with the chemokine receptor CXCR4.

In other models, cytoskeletal re-organization induces the expression of <italic toggle="yes">CXCR4</italic>, the SDF-1&#945; chemokine receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">38</xref></sup> As seen in our experiments, both neonatal and adult CPCs exhibited elevated expression of <italic toggle="yes">SDF1A</italic>, which correlates to the age-independent increase in migratory capacity of CPCs following spaceflight.</p><p id="Par28">Interestingly, the age-dependent changes in developmental status following culture aboard the ISS suggest fundamental differences in adult CPCs. While KEGG analysis demonstrated that functionally similar pathways are likely affected in both adult and neonatal CPCs, only the latter population experienced significant changes to the expression of cytoskeletal genes and early developmental markers. This trend was supported by the significantly increased cell cycle and proliferation patterns observed only in neonatal CPCs. Broad differences have already been reported to exist between adult and neonatal CPCs, including at the genetic/epigenetic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and proteomic levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">39</xref></sup> In particular, the secretome of adult CPCs was found to exhibit a greater number of proteins related to anti-proliferation, pro-apoptosis, and senescence. Meanwhile, the secretome of neonatal CPCs exhibited higher levels of telomerases as well as proteins related to cell cycle, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">39</xref></sup> Similarly, we observed age-disparate responses to spaceflight in nearly all of these categories. In the context of this experiment, microRNA dysregulation may have exerted a greater effect on neonatal CPCs given their relatively higher levels of expression of genes related to these processes. Nevertheless, the prospective use of CPCs in autologous cardiac stem cell therapies in a predominately adult population requires that these functional differences be elucidated.</p><p id="Par29">Although the ISS represents a truly unique opportunity to conduct life science research in space, there are several limitations that do not exist in the well-controlled laboratory environments on Earth. In addition to the stress associated with rocket launch, the limited availability of astronauts once aboard the ISS impacts the otherwise routine maintenance of cell cultures. For this reason, future research should consider the influence of various spaceflight-related stressors, such as sheer and vibrational stressors, on stem cell processes under normal gravity conditions. For example, we have shown that 2D clinorotation on Earth, which was performed in a carefully controlled laboratory setting, impacted the developmental properties of CPCs in a manner that was similar to spaceflight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">27</xref></sup></p><p id="Par30">As humans prepare to expand our presence in space, it is imperative to deepen our understanding of the nature of cellular adaptation to spaceflight so that we may develop mechanisms by which these molecular changes in cardiac cell types can be countered. Meanwhile, on Earth, we can further explore the therapeutic potential of these adaptations for cardiac repair.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Isolation and culture of early CPCs</title><p id="Par31">CPCs were isolated from cardiac tissue of neonatal (1&#8201;day&#8211;1 month) or adult (57&#8211;72 year old) human patients, as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">27</xref></sup> The methods were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations and were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Loma Linda University for the use of discarded tissue without identifiable private information under a waiver of informed consent. Thus, informed consent was not required since the discarded tissue was not collected specifically for this study, and the tissue was obtained with no identifiable patient-specific information. Briefly, atrial tissue was cut into small clumps (approximately 1.0&#8201;mm<sup>3</sup>) then enzymatically digested using collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) at a working concentration of 1&#8201;mg/mL. The resulting solution was then passed through a 40-&#181;m cell strainer. Cells were cloned in a 96-well plate by limiting dilution to a final concentration of 0.8 cells per well to create populations for expansion.
