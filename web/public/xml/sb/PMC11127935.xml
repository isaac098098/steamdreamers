TDPs are often expressed at high levels in tardigrades upon desiccation, and appear to mediate stress adaptation. Here, we focus on the proteins belonging to the secreted family of tardigrade proteins termed secretory-abundant heat soluble (&#8220;SAHS&#8221;) proteins, and investigate their ability to protect diverse biological structures. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins prevent desiccated liposomes from fusion, and enhance desiccation tolerance of <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rhizobium tropici</italic> upon extracellular application. Molecular dynamics simulation and comparative structural analysis suggest a model by which SAHS proteins may undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, in which removal of water and solutes from a large internal cavity in SAHS proteins destabilizes the beta-sheet structure.

Thus, the description of these proteins as &#8220;intrinsically disordered proteins&#8221; is not accurate, at least in the hydrated state. All of these proteins are unusual in that they have a large internal cavity that may be filled with ligands, solvent molecules, or both. The sides of the cavity are defined by beta sheets that, for the most part, do not pack against a typical hydrophobic core. In the RvSAHS1 and RvSAHS4 structures solved by Fukuda and colleagues, this volume is occupied by solvent molecules.</p><p id="Par24">In RvSAHS1, there is a small hydrophobic core, while the cavity is bordered by beta-hairpin loops from Phe50-His72, His83-Val96, Thr106-Ile113, Ala126-Asp139, and Lys150-Tyr163. (The Phe50-His72 loop also contains two short alpha helices.) In the absence of a ligand in the cavity, both faces of these loops are simply beta-sheets that face water on both sides. Thus, these structures would not be as stabilized as in a typical protein. We hypothesize that during a desiccation process, water would equilibrate out of the cavity, and as the environment becomes more dehydrated, other more stable proteins would pack against an SAHS protein, essentially crushing it and disrupting the beta-sheet structure that surrounds the cavity. In this way, the SAHS proteins could act as deformable packing material to prevent other biological structures from deforming or rupturing during desiccation.</p><p id="Par25">Among the 13 SAHS proteins of <italic toggle="yes">R. varieornatus</italic>, the amino acids pointing into the small hydrophobic center are generally conserved, while amino acids pointing into the cavity are not.

Of these, Trp 32, Trp37, Met38, Trp41, Phe98, Leu100, Leu124, Tyr/Phe141, Val143, and Leu148 are rather well conserved, while the others are not. We note that the highly conserved tryptophans at positions 32, 37, and 41 are present in our newly proposed sequences for RvSAHS 9, 10, and 12, supporting the idea that these sequences were previously misannotated.</p><p id="Par26">The amino acids pointing inward towards the cavity include Phe50, Phe53, Ile54, Leu57, Leu59, His83, Ile85, Val87, Lys90, Tyr92, Asp94, Thr106, His108, Leu113, Tyr115, Tyr117, Ala126, Val128, Val130, Ile137, Asp139, Lys150, Tyr152, Arg151, and Tyr165.

Arg/Lys161 is notable because it is conserved in fatty acid binding proteins and interacts with the carboxyl group in the fatty acid in the same way that this amino acid interacts with a carboxyl group on a putative fatty acid in the SAHS1 structure.</p><p id="Par27">Another feature of the SAHS proteins and fatty acid-binding proteins is the presence of an entry/exit point. In RvSAHS1, four turns define this area&#8212;three beta-hairpins with tips at Lys90, Asn109, and Ser132, and a one-turn alpha helix with Gln63 pointing towards the hole. The amino acid sequences around this region are extremely variable among the <italic toggle="yes">R. varieornatus</italic> SAHS proteins, with Gln63 and Ser132 near the edge of a gap in the alignment. Moreover, since the SAHS proteins are secreted eukaryotic proteins, they can undergo N-linked glycosylation at Asn-X-Ser/Thr sites (which are not captured in proteins made in <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic>). The distribution of putative N-linked glycosylation sites in RvSAHS1-13 is strongly biased toward the amino acids surrounding the entry/exit site: Asn109 is likely N-glycosylated in RvSAHS1, 2, 8, 10, and 11 (and Asn107 in RvSAHS5); in RvSAHS3, 8 and 9 sites near Gln63 are likely glycosylated; and in RvSAHS5, 9 and 11 sites near Ser132 are glycosylated. RvSAHS4, 6, 12, and 13 do not have N-linked glycosylation sites. Of the 14 putative N-linked glycosylation sites in RvSAHS1-13, twelve are near the opening into the cavity. The presence/absence and positioning of these sites may have a significant effect on the movement of water and other small molecules in and out of the cavity.</p><p id="Par28">Fukuda et al. discussed the possibility that RvSAHS1 may bind a ligand with a carboxyl group (e.g. acetate) but noted that not all of the SAHS proteins have these carboxyl-binding residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

In addition, we observed that the SAHS proteins undergo structural shift upon exposure to a desiccation-mimicking compound and used a diverse set of experimental and computational approaches to suggest possible models of how the structural transition of SAHS proteins might occur to protect biological structures. Specifically, we found that the SAHS proteins protect membrane-containing structures, specifically liposomes and living bacteria, against desiccation-induced disruption but are no better than BSA at protecting the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase against desiccation. Based on CD analysis, the SAHS proteins appear to undergo a shift from a primarily beta-sheet structure to an alpha-helical structure in increasing TFE concentrations (thought to be desiccation-mimicking conditions), and a 1&#8201;&#956;s molecular dynamic simulation showed that short alpha-helices can transiently form upon denaturation of proteins. Lastly, we performed a comparative structural analysis based on the available putative sequences of SAHS proteins. In doing so, we found that sequences in the Uniprot database corresponding to short (N-terminally truncated) SAHS proteins may have been incorrectly annotated and that all SAHS proteins are likely secreted and share a common structure. As noted previously, SAHS proteins are distantly related to fatty acid-binding proteins and consist of a large cavity and a small hydrophobic core off to one side.

In the presence of 10&#8201;mg/mL of any of the SAHS proteins, the extent of liposome fusion was much reduced, and even at lower concentrations, there was a protective effect. The excipient disaccharide trehalose showed a comparable protective effect, while BSA was less protective (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).

The SAHS proteins are similar in sequence to fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs), and the SAHS and FABP structures are superimposable. However, the amino acid side chains that point inward in the SAHS protein cavity are not strongly conserved, suggesting that these proteins are not binding to a particular ligand but may simply be filled with water or with variable solutes. Moreover, in FABPs the cavity is significantly larger than can be occupied by a fatty acid, and since fatty acids are moving in and out of the cavity during intracellular transport, they are presumably exchanged with water in this process.<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Glycosylation sites in the SAHS proteins of <italic toggle="yes">R. varieornatus</italic> cluster near the cavity opening.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Structure of SAHS1 from Fukuda et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, showing an alpha-carbon trace of all amino acids, with the beta-hairpins surrounding the cavity colored in yellow, yellow-orange, orange and red.

These structures might nucleate the formation of an alternative, protective conformation. However, the use of molecular dynamics to simulate desiccation is challenging because, during actual desiccation, the concentration of other proteins would increase and may play a dominating role in a conformational change of SAHS proteins, for example, through Brownian collisions. Moreover, desiccation occurs on long timescales that cannot be simulated with current molecular dynamics technology.</p><p id="Par36">One model for the protective mechanism of SAHS proteins is that the SAHS protein cavity is filled with water and possibly other solutes in the hydrated state, but during dehydration, the water is extruded. Thus, the SAHS protein would collapse as a result of the Brownian motion of macromolecules and pressure on the outside of the protein without a corresponding pressure from the inside. This would lead to the denaturation of the protein and transition to an alternative, protective conformation. The different SAHS proteins may have different kinetics and equilibria for this transition, such that when a tardigrade is dehydrated, there is a gradual conversion of the different SAHS proteins to a protective state. The presence or absence and positioning of N-linked oligosaccharides in the different SAHS proteins near the entry/exit point may give them distinct dehydration-transition characteristics.
