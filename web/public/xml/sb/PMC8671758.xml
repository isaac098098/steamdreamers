Endochondral bone formation is an important procedure of growth plate determining the bone growth, where this procedure is also regulated by estrogen and its receptor (ER) signaling pathway. The present study is undertaken to explore the roles of ERs in regulating the different growth patterns in ob/ob mice. In this study, C57BL/6 female mice were used as wild-type (WT) mice; ob/ob mice and WT mice were age-matched fed, and bone length is analyzed by X-ray plain film at the 12 weeks old. We confirm that ob/ob mice have shorter femoral length and longer spine length than WT mice (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation proteins and hypertrophic marker proteins are also observed from the femur and spinal growth plate of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). Spearman&#8217;s analysis showed that body length (axial and appendicular length) is positively related to the expression level of ER&#945; in growth plate. Three-week-old female ob/ob mice are randomized divided into three groups: 1) ob/ob + ctrl, 2) ob/ob + ER&#945; antagonist (MPP), and 3) ob/ob + ER&#946; antagonist (PHTPP). Age-matched C57BL/6 mice were also divided into three groups, same as the groups of ob/ob mice. MPP and PHTPP were administered by intraperitoneal injection for 6 weeks. However, the results of X-ray and H&amp;E staining demonstrate that leptin deficiency seems to disturb the regulating effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth. These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ER&#945; might be associated with contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in ob/ob mice. However, ER signaling on longitudinal bone growth was blunted by leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice, and the underlying association between ERs and leptin needs to be explored in future work.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>estrogen receptor</kwd><kwd>leptin</kwd><kwd>skeletal longitudinal growth</kwd><kwd>growth plate</kwd><kwd>endochondral bone formation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="5378"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Leptin, a protein encoded by obese gene (ob), has been shown to have regulative effects on longitudinal bone growth, spongiosa maturation, and bone turnover between cortical and cancellous bones (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The mammalian second growth spurt period occurs at puberty. One of the characterizations for the growth spurt is rapid skeletal longitudinal growth. Results in a clinical investigation, in order to clarify the relationship between anthropometric data and concentrations of serum leptin in the catch-up growth procedure, showed that increasing leptin concentrations might trigger catch-up growth in children recovering from malnutrition (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Furthermore, leptin was considered as an important facilitator in early puberty (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In addition, findings of leptin deficiency in mice and humans leading to abnormal bone development suggested that leptin plays a novel role in the linear growth of bone (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Endochondral bone formation is the key procedure for growth plate (GP), in which GP chondrocytes undergo a series of organized procedures including proliferation, maturation, hypertrophic differentiation, and calcification (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These complex and delicate programs of endochondral bone formation are responsible for the skeletal elongation. The femoral GP of ob/ob mice is abnormal combined with poorly organized collagen fibril and decreased the expression level of type X collagen (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Further lab investigations showed that leptin could enhance the proliferation and differentiation of GP chondrocytes <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Additional leptin treatment increased condyle height in an organ model (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Importantly, supplementation of leptin to ob/ob mice could reverse the defects in femoral GP and bone morphology (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, interesting different growth patterns have been shown in ob/ob mice with a shorter femora length and a longer vertebral length than wild-type (WT) mice (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), while the underlying mechanism of this contrasting phenotypes still remains unclear.</p><p>Although leptin played an important role in the abnormal skeletal bone growth, leptin was a multiple-effect hormone, affecting energy metabolism, appetite, thermogenesis, immune system, and neuroendocrine (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), each of which could independently determine the growth pattern of skeletal bone longitudinal growth (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Leptin is responsible for the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, and leptin deficiency directly leads to a reduced level of estrogen in ob/ob mice (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Estrogen and its receptor (ER&#945; and ER&#946;) signaling pathway played an essential role in skeletal growth, and the absence of estrogen in rats presented an accelerated bone elongation as compared with that in normal female rats (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Effects of different ERs (&#945; and &#946;) on the axial and appendicular bone elongation were distinct, which were proved by ER knock-out mice. ER&#945; knock-out mice showed a decreasing bone growth, while mice with inactivation of ER&#946; had increased appendicular bone growth (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Our previous study also showed that blocking different ERs presented opposite effects on the appendicular longitudinal growth (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Recently, a crosstalk effect between leptin and ERs in the endochondral bone formation has been reported in our previous study (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), and a stage-specific effect of leptin on the ER expression was obvious during the hypertrophic differentiation stage in a model of chondrocyte differentiation <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The integration of estrogen and leptin signaling, which is responsible for contrasting growth patterns in appendicular and axial longitudinal growth <italic toggle="yes">via</italic> ERs, is still unknown.</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that leptin deficiency may influence the ER expression in axial and appendicular GP <italic toggle="yes">in&#160;vivo</italic>, contributing to the contrasting phenotypes of skeletal growth in ob/ob mice. The current study was designed to determine the role of ERs in the skeletal longitudinal growth of leptin deficiency mice. We examine the femur and spinal GP using densitometric, histomorphometric, and immunohistochemical techniques to expand our current understanding of how the absence of leptin affects axial and appendicular growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Animals</title><p>Three-week-old female B6/JGpt-Lep<sup>em1Cd25/Gpt</sup> mice on the C57BL/6 background (ob/ob mice, n = 6/group) and 3-week-old female C57BL/6 (n = 6/group) mice were purchased from Nanjing GemPharmatech Co., Ltd.

(Jiangsu, China) and were randomly divided into eight groups. In the first stage, C57BL/6 was used as WT (n = 6), ob/ob mouse was used as ob/ob (n = 6). These two groups of mice did not receive any drug treatment and were euthanized for tissue collection. In order to determine the role of ERs in skeletal growth of ob/ob mice, the second stage was performed as follows: WT, ob/ob control (ob/ob + ctrl), ob/ob mice treated with methyl-piperidino-pyrazole, an ER&#945;-selective antagonist (ob/ob + MPP), and ob/ob mice were treated with 4-(2-phenyl-5,7-bis(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo(1,5-<italic toggle="yes">a</italic>)pyrimidin-3-yl)phenol, an ER&#946;-selective antagonist (ob/ob + PHTPP). After 1 week of adaptive feeding, mice were treated with different kinds of ER antagonists during the puberty of female mice (4 to 10 weeks). The control group ob/ob mice were subcutaneously injected with 100 &#956;l of saline solution. The MPP group mice and PHTPP group mice were intraperitoneally injected with MPP [0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1&#8240; dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)] and PHTPP (0.3 mg/kg/day, dissolved in 1&#8240; DMSO), respectively, according to previous studies (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

The current study provides further evidence for the effects of leptin deficiency on the contrasting phenotypes on axial and appendicular bone growth, in which leptin deficiency results in region-specific expression of ER&#945; at the femoral and vertebral GP in ob/ob female mice. According to the axial and appendicular bone length results, we showed that ob/ob mice have a shorter femur length and a longer spinal length than WT mice. IHC staining results also showed opposite results of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral and spinal GP of ob/ob mice. Expression of ERs using IHC, WB, and qPCR methods demonstrated that femur GP has a lower level of ER&#945;, and spinal GP has a higher level of ER&#945; in ob/ob mice compared with those of WT mice. No differences were observed in the expression of ER&#946; of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice. Spearman&#8217;s analysis showed that body length was positively correlated with the expression level of ER&#945;. Antagonists of ERs showed a different regulatory effect on femur length in WT mice, but blocking different ERs did not present regulatory effects on the skeletal longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Taken together, our data suggested that the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of spine and limb induced by leptin deficiency may partially attribute to region-specific expression of ER&#945; in the femoral and spinal GP. Leptin deficiency also blunted the regulatory effects of ER antagonists on the longitudinal growth in ob/ob mice. Still, the underlying mechanisms of the cross talk between leptin and ER signaling need to be studied in the future.</p><p>Puberty was the second growth peak in mammals. Except for the secondary sexual characteristics, body longitudinal growth was one of the important markers of the puberty (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition to the regulation of metabolism and reproduction, leptin was reportedly important for the skeletal bone growth (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Recently, leptin deficiency has been shown to lead to a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length compared with WT mice using the 6-month-old and prepubertal female ob/ob mice (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Supplementation of leptin has been shown to increase femoral length in ob/ob mice, but it could not achieve absolute re-established length as compared with WT mice (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). In the present study, we confirmed that leptin deficiency induced a shorter femoral length and a longer vertebrae length in the post-pubertal (12-week old) ob/ob mice compared with WT mice, which suggested that the absence of leptin may be the primary factor for the contrasting growth pattern between limb and spine during the whole life of ob/ob female mice. Previous studies have shown that leptin receptor was expressed in cartilaginous skeletal growth centers, articular cartilage, and osteoblasts (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Our previous study also showed that leptin receptor was expressed in the femur and spinal GP (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> expression of leptin receptor at the GP supported that leptin directly affected the GP. GP thickness was an important histological marker for the longitudinal bone growth (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Here, we focused on the GPs and found that the femoral GP was thinner than that of WT mice, and the spinal GP was thicker than that of WT mice. Leptin deficiency decreased the proliferative zone and hypertrophic zone height in the femoral GP compared with the WT mice, but the ratio of hypertrophic/proliferative zone was higher in ob/ob mice. The contrasting GP patterns of the femur and vertebrae were in line with the general femoral and spinal length observation. As we know, endochondral ossification was the major process that contributed to skeletal bone longitudinal growth (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). During this procedural transition from cartilage to bone, the potential abilities of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy were important for GP thickness and were further responsible for longitudinal bone growth (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Chondrocytes in different phases of GP secreted unique matrix proteins. Collagen II and aggrecan were used as the markers of GP cellular proliferation. Meanwhile, collagen X and MMP13 were the typical features of GP hypertrophy (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). The results of our study demonstrated that leptin deficiency decreased the expression of extracellular matrix marker proteins in femur GP as compared with those in the WT mice, which was in line with the results of Tuner and colleagues (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix makers were at a higher level in the spinal GP as compared with those in the spinal GP of WT mice and the femur GP of ob/ob mice. Collectively, the results of the extracellular matrix maker expression patterns in femoral and spinal GP support the contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of the limb and spine.</p><p>To explore the mechanism of this interesting phenomenon, we further focused on the expression of ERs in the femoral and spinal GP. Estrogen was a key hormone in puberty of female mammals, and it was also an important factor that may influence the process of skeletal bone line growth (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). ERs mediated cellular response of estrogen, and previous studies using different global ER knock-out mouse models have suggested that ER&#945; and ER&#946; presented opposing effects on longitudinal bone growth in female mice (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). ER&#946; knock-out adult mice have increased skeletal length compared with WT female mice, while ER&#945; knock-out mice presented decreased longitudinal bone growth (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). A previous study has shown that the expression level of ERs (especially ER&#945;) was high at the arcuate nucleus in ob/ob mice (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, in our previous studies (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), there were cross-talk effects between leptin and ERs <italic toggle="yes">in&#160;vitro</italic>. However, no reports have been focused on the expression pattern of ERs located at the spinal and femoral GP in ob/ob mice <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic>. In the present study, our data first showed that the expression level of ER&#945; was lower in the femoral GP of ob/ob mice compared with the WT mice, and the level of ER&#945; was higher in the spinal GP of ob/ob mice compared with WT mice or the femoral GP of ob/ob mice. In addition, there were no significant changes in ER&#946; located at the femoral and spinal GP. ER&#945; was considered as a growth promoter in the skeletal development (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). These interesting findings of our study may partially explain the mechanisms of contrasting phenotypes in bone growth of limb and spine. Low expression of ER&#945; in femoral GP resulted in short limbs, and high expression of ER&#945; in spinal GP resulted in long vertebrae. The expression level of ER&#945; was positively correlated with axial and appendicular bone length according to the results of Spearman&#8217;s analysis. Furthermore, ER antagonists were used to determine the role of ER&#945; in regulating the longitudinal bone growth. In line with our previous study (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), the present data showed that ER&#945; blocking directly resulted in decreasing appendicular longitudinal growth, whereas ER&#946; blocking led to increasing appendicular longitudinal growth in the WT mice. However, selective ER antagonists did not present regulative effects on the longitudinal growth of the ob/ob mice. Taken together, our results show that leptin deficiency directly induced the different expression patterns of ER&#945; at femoral and vertebral GP and low serum estradiol level in ob/ob mice during puberty, and the regulative effects of ER antagonists were disturbed by the absence of leptin. Given the complex effects of leptin deficiency in regulating the bone growth, more specific mechanisms are needed to be explored.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that leptin deficiency presented contrasting phenotypes in axial and appendicular growth of ob/ob mice at the end of puberty, with reduced level of proliferative and hypertrophic markers in femoral GP and an increased level of these markers in spinal GP. Furthermore, we first found a significant change of expression of ER&#945; located at femoral and spinal GP (lower in femoral GP and higher in spinal GP as compared with that in WT mice). These findings suggested that region-specific expression of ER&#945; might be associated with the formation of contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth in the ob/ob mice. However, further studies are needed to clarify the relation between ERs and leptin in regulating endochondral ossification.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The original contributions presented in the study are included in the article/supplementary material.
