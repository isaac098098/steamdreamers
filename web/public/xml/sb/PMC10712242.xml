Combining transcriptomics and proteomics approaches, this research gives insights into the coordination of transcriptome and proteome in Arabidopsis&#8217; molecular and physiological responses to Spaceflight environmental stress. Arabidopsis seedlings were germinated and grown in microgravity (&#181;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in NASA Biological Research in Canisters &#8211; Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED) hardware, with the ground control established on Earth. At 10 days old, seedlings were frozen in RNA-later and returned to Earth. RNA-seq transcriptomics and TMT-labeled LC-MS/MS proteomic analysis of cellular fractionates from the plant tissues suggest the alteration of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) in spaceflight, with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. An overview of the ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities in spaceflight revealed a significant abundance of transcripts and proteins involved in protease binding, nuclease activities, and mRNA binding in spaceflight, while those involved in tRNA binding, exoribonuclease activity, and RNA helicase activity were less abundant in spaceflight. CELLULOSE SYNTHASES (CESA1, CESA3, CESA5, CESA7) and CELLULOSE-LIKE PROTEINS (CSLE1, CSLG3), involved in cellulose deposition and TUBULIN COFACTOR B (TFCB) had reduced abundance in spaceflight. This contrasts with the increased expression of UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs, involved in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight. Both transcripts and proteome suggested an altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transportation in spaceflight. Analyses also suggest an increased metabolic energy requirement for plants in Space than on Earth, hence, the activation of several shunt metabolic pathways. This study provides novel insights, based on integrated RNA and protein data, on how plants adapt to the spaceflight environment and it is a step further at achieving sustainable crop production in Space.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>spaceflight</kwd><kwd>gravitropism</kwd><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>RNAseq</kwd><kwd>TMT</kwd><kwd>BRIC LED</kwd><kwd>International Space Station</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

In their diversity, these studies have accumulated an extensive array of phenotypic characterizations and uncovered some of the fundamental concepts related to physiological adaptation in space (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kordyum and Hasenstein, 2021</xref>). However, the traditional approaches have recently been complemented and in many ways superseded by the advent of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic methods, setting the stage for high throughput analyses that investigates the effects of spaceflight on plants from a molecular and functional perspective (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hughes and Kiss, 2022</xref>). This allows the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment to be characterized beyond phenotyping and extensively mapped out along broader biochemical pathways and cryptic signaling molecular cascades. While some remarkable advancements in genomic and transcriptomics studies of plants in spaceflight have been widely recorded (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Ferl et&#160;al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#160;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Barker et&#160;al., 2023</xref>), such studies have largely been conducted in isolation, independent of proteomics. Unlike genomic and transcriptomic studies, proteomics studies face certain limitations in the spaceflight context, predominantly due to the limited availability of plant tissues for analysis. As a result, comprehensive spaceflight proteomics studies conducted on the whole Arabidopsis plant have been relatively few, with only three reported so far (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mazars et&#160;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ferl et&#160;al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Barker et&#160;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et&#160;al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>

(2015)</xref> proteomic study on Arabidopsis callus aboard the Chinese SZ-8 spacecraft in spaceflight. <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Ferl et&#160;al. (2015)</xref> comparison of the transcriptome and protein abundances between the leaf and root of Arabidopsis in spaceflight represented the first use of a combined transcriptomics-proteomics investigative approach for whole plant spaceflight experiment, followed by a similar but more in-depth approach by <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et&#160;al. (2020)</xref> where they revealed novel regulatory responses of Arabidopsis seedlings in spaceflight. Reports from these two multi-omics studies indicated that the true power of omics approaches becomes apparent when they are combined, providing a comprehensive view of how gene expression and protein synthesis respond to the unique conditions of spaceflight. Likewise, the reported low correlation between transcripts and proteome of Arabidopsis grown in spaceflight and spaceflight hardware (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Basu et&#160;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et&#160;al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et&#160;al., 2020</xref>) reinforced the benefits of a multi-omics approach.</p><p>Studying plants&#8217; adaptation to the spaceflight environment usually involves plants being flown to the ISS in designated hardware, whose designs and subsequent improvements are often based on the objectives of the experiment at hand (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Kanapskyte et&#160;al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nicholson et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). One such hardware is the Biological Research In Canister &#8211; Light Emitting Diode (BRIC LED). BRIC LED hardware is designed to enhance the capabilities of existing BRIC Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFU) by the incorporation of a customizable discreet lighting system. Hence, biological organisms growing in the BRIC LED hardware are illuminated by LEDs with options of four different wavelengths (blue, red, far-red, and white) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Howard and Caron, 2016</xref>). Spaceflight experiments in the BRIC LED hardware expose plants to light cues in microgravity, hence closely simulating a natural environment where plants have to simultaneously integrate light and gravitational signaling. The incorporation of weightlessness and light signaling is expected to elicit several physiological and molecular responses which are distinct from other hardware without a light source (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stankovic, 2018</xref>), with the responses often novel and a function of cross-talks among various signaling pathways rather than an individual signal transduction pathway. Tightly regulated by complex cross-signaling pathways, the responses are usually specific to each plant organ and most times, tissues (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wolinska and Berens, 2019</xref>). Transcripts and proteomes encoding these stress response pathways are usually localized to a particular intracellular or extracellular region, further reinforcing the idea that studies on plant stress response should be focused on finer resolutions of organs, tissues, cells, and organelles. Several studies have identified that the plant root and shoot respond in an organ-specific manner to gravity (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#160;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink et&#160;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Lamers et&#160;al., 2020</xref>) and other environmental stresses (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Paponov et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). Hence, resolving plant proteomic responses to the spaceflight environment on an organ-specific level is a step further in understanding stress response signaling pathways and the molecular adaptations of each plant organ to the spaceflight environment and how such adaptation mechanisms can be manipulated for improved plant production in space and on earth.</p><p>Therefore, building upon these previous achievements in plant multi-omics research in spaceflight, we took a significant step forward by integrating both proteomics and transcriptomics approaches to understand the response of Arabidopsis plants to the spaceflight environment. Through increased coverage and finer spatial proteomic resolution, we assessed the effects of the earth&#8217;s low orbit spaceflight environment aboard the ISS on the shoot and root of the Arabidopsis seedlings. The seedlings were grown in the NASA BRIC LED hardware, hence we provided robust insight into the plant transcriptome landscape and organ-specific proteomic responses of Arabidopsis to the spaceflight environment, while at the same time conducting a hardware verification test for the novel BRIC LED hardware.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2_1"><label>2.1</label><title>Plant material and spaceflight growth conditions</title><p>
<italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> L., ecotype Columbia-0 seeds were surface sterilized with 30% (v/v) bleach, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 2 mins, washed repeatedly with sterile water (5&#215;) and dried on round filter paper. Approximately 30 seeds were plated on each 60mm round petri plate containing 6.7ml of 0.5&#215; + Benomyl Murashige and Skoog (MS) growth media with Gamborg&#8217;s B5 vitamins, 0.5% (w/v) sucrose and 0.75% (w/v) phytagel, and cold stratified for 16h. Seeded plates were loaded in a horizontal orientation, with the face of the growth media parallel to the ground in the BRIC LED hardware petri dish fixation units (PDFUs). Each hardware canister holds 6 PDFUs, with each PDFU holding a 60mm petri plate. This configuration was replicated 6 times, making a total of 36 seeded 60mm plates loaded aboard ISS. All BRICs were kept in cold storage (4&#176;C) prior to the spaceflight launch. The experiment was flown on the SpaceX CRS-13 mission launched aboard the Falcon 9 Full Thrust rocket on December 15, 2017. The dormant Arabidopsis seeds were activated with light and placed at ambient temperature aboard the ISS, with a light wavelength composition of 85% red, 15% blue, and 60 &#181;mol m<sup>&#8722;2</sup> s<sup>&#8722;1</sup> intensity. The plants were grown for 10 days with a 4-hour/2-hour light-dark cycle, prior to actuation of the PDFUs, releasing about 6&#8211;7ml RNAlater into the petri plates for seedling fixation. The seedlings were then incubated in Invitrogen RNAlater for 12 hours after which they were frozen aboard the ISS MELFI at &#8722;80&#176;C until returned to Earth on May 5, 2018, aboard the SpaceX CRS-14 cargo dragon. A similar experimental setup was established on the ground, for same duration, at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida in the Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber, USA. The samples were transported on dry ice from the dragon capsule to the receiving laboratories. Frozen plates containing both the spaceflight and ground samples were packed in dry ice and transported to Ohio University where they were stored at &#8722;80&#176;C prior to protein extraction and processing while another group was also sent to the University of Florida, Gainesville for RNA extraction, library preparation and sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2_2"><label>2.2</label><title>RNA extraction and sequencing</title><p>For each condition (Spaceflight and Ground), four individual plants from each replicate were pooled for RNA extraction. Individual plants were first dissected into leaves, hypocotyls, and root tissues under an Olympus dissecting microscope (Olympus, Japan). The intervening hypocotyls were set aside and not processed for downstream analyses. Leaf tissues without their hypocotyl are referred to herein as shoots and are the only ones processed for RNA analysis. RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s guidelines. RNA concentration was assessed using the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), and RNA quality was determined on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies Inc., USA). For all samples, the RNA integrity number (RIN) was more than 6.</p><p>RNA-Sequencing Library Preparation was performed at the University of Florida Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research (ICBR) Gene Expression Core (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biotech.ufl.edu/gene-expression-genotyping/</ext-link> RRID: SCR_019145). Here, 100 ng of total RNA was used for mRNA isolation using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7490). Next, RNA library construction was done with the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, catalog #E7760) according to the manufacturer&#8217;s user guide. Briefly, RNA was fragmented in NEBNext First Strand Synthesis Buffer via incubation at 94&#176;C for the desired time. This step was followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis using reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primer. Synthesis of ds-cDNA was performed using the 2nd strand master mix provided in the kit, followed by end-repair and adaptor ligation. At this point, Illumina adaptors were ligated to the sample. Finally, each library (uniquely barcoded) was enriched by 12 cycles of amplification, and purified with Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, catalog #A63881). The 12 barcoded libraries were sized on the Bioanalyzer and quantified with the Qubit<sup>&#174;</sup> 2.0 Fluorometer. Finally, these 20 individual libraries were pooled in equimolar concentration.</p><p>The Illumina NovaSeq 6000 was used to sequence the libraries for 2 &#215; 150 cycles. Sequencing was performed at the ICBR NextGen Sequencing (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/" ext-link-type="uri">https://biotech.ufl.edu/next-gen-dna/</ext-link>, RRID: SCR_019152). Normalized libraries were submitted to the &#8220;Free Adapter Blocking Reagent&#8221; protocol (FAB, catalog #20024145) to minimize the presence of adaptor-dimers and index hopping rates. The library pool was diluted to 0.8 nM and sequenced on one S4 flow cell lane (2 &#215; 150 cycles) of the Illumina NovaSeq6000. The instrument&#8217;s computer utilized the NovaSeq Control Software v1.6. Cluster and SBS consumables were v1.5. The final loading concentration of the library was 120 pM with 1% PhiX (v/v) spike-in control. One lane generated 2.5&#8211;3 billion paired-end reads (~950Gb) with an average Q30%&#8805;92.5% and Cluster PF=85.4%. FastQ files were generated using the BCL2fastQ function in the Illumina BaseSpace portal. One NovaSeq S4, 2 &#215; 150 cycles lane resulted in an average of 50 million demultiplexed, paired-end reads when sequencing a pool of 48 samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2_3"><label>2.3</label><title>Protein extraction, sample processing and LC-MS/MS</title><p>Seedlings from spaceflight and ground controls were divided into root and shoot for soluble and membrane protein extractions according to a protocol adapted from <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Basu et&#160;al.

This study further provides insight into how the specific plant organs (root and shoot) respond to microgravity in spaceflight. The organ-targeted proteomic profiling in response to microgravity, in this study, revealed that roots and shoots adapt differently to the spaceflight environment, and at the same time, they share certain commonalities. Comparing root-specific protein abundance in spaceflight to Earth, 400 membrane proteins and 75 soluble proteins were more abundant in space, whereas 606 membrane proteins and 71 soluble proteins were less abundant in spaceflight (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

Likewise, the abundance of 593 membrane proteins and 91 soluble proteins was reduced in spaceflight across both organs. Interestingly, a comparison of the differentially abundant proteins shared by both organs revealed that 18 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the root and less abundant in the shoot, while 34 membrane proteins were more abundant in spaceflight in the shoot and less abundant in the root (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">

A GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis of the 34 membrane proteins with increased abundance in the shoot and decreased abundance in the root in spaceflight revealed that they were majorly involved in the photosynthetic pathway, carbon metabolism pathway, and amide biosynthetic process.

cell division, cell death, etc., are tightly linked with the location of specific transcripts and proteins (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Christopher et&#160;al., 2022</xref>). Transcripts are targeted toward different subcellular organelles in the plant cell based on the specific functions of encoded proteins. Assessing which of the targeted organelles have the highest amount of perturbed proteins gives insight into the metabolic process most affected by the spaceflight environment. Our expectation is that since transcripts encode proteins that are targeted toward different organelles, the pattern of subcellular localization of the RNA transcripts differentially expressed should be similar to that of proteins differentially expressed in spaceflight. To ascertain this, we compared transcripts and proteins with differential abundance in our spaceflight experiments against SUBA4, and results were subsequently fed into SUBAcon (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hooper et&#160;al., 2017</xref>) to recover more accurate proteome-wide subcellular localizations.</p><p>Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins constituted the largest percentage of the transcripts upregulated (25%) and downregulated (28.5%) in spaceflight (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#160;2A</bold>
</xref>). KEGG pathway analysis of the nucleus-targeted transcripts upregulated in spaceflight indicated that they are majorly involved in plant hormone signal transduction pathways which are tryptophan metabolism, zeatin biosynthesis, diterpenoid biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure&#160;2A</bold>
</xref>). Transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins downregulated in spaceflight are involved in protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and ribosome pathway, with many being part of the ubiquitin ligase complex and the ER-associated degradation complex (ERAD) (<xref rid="SM1" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Figure&#160;2B</bold>
</xref>). Another interesting group of transcripts are those encoding proteins targeted towards extracellular matrix, being 20% of the total upregulated RNA and 11.1% of the total downregulated RNA. Upregulated transcripts encoding extracellular-matrix targeted proteins are enriched in cell wall biogenesis, cell wall macromolecule metabolic process, and flavonoid metabolic process, while the downregulated ones are uniquely enriched in pathways involved in response to salicylic acid, polysaccharide biosynthetic process, response to brassinosteroid and cell wall organization (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

</xref>). Enrichment analysis of root plastid localized proteins that were differentially abundant in spaceflight indicated that proteins involved in plastid movements, organization of plastid membranes, and light harvesting were less abundant in spaceflight than on earth, while those involved in valine biosynthetic pathways, reductive pentose-phosphate cycle, and the dark reaction of photosynthesis were more abundant in spaceflight. The valine biosynthetic pathway is intertwined with the isoleucine biosynthetic pathway, and they both inhibit the growth of shoots (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Cao et&#160;al., 2019</xref>) and increase root formation. Notably, 154 membrane and 51 soluble extracellular localized proteins were abundant in spaceflight in the root and they are majorly involved in glycan degradation, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and pentose-glucuronate interconversion. This is indicative of increased restructuring of the root cell wall polysaccharides in spaceflight.</p><p>The distribution of protein localization in the shoot is similar to the root, with plastid localized proteins constituting 32.4% of proteins less abundant in spaceflight, while cytosolic protein constituted 33.4% of the proteins more abundant in spaceflight (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#160;2A</bold>

However, enrichment analysis of shoot plastid localized proteins indicated high enrichment of proteins involved in plastid transcription and organization, chlorophyll metabolism, and photosynthesis. Contrary to the root, 83 membrane and 63 soluble extracellular proteins were more abundant in spaceflight and they are highly enriched in pathways for cellular oxidation regulation and negative regulation of peptidase activities. Extracellular proteins less abundant in spaceflight are enriched in pathways responsible for plant defense. An interesting observation as regards the comparative subcellular localization of transcriptome and root and shoot proteome in spaceflight is that most downregulated RNA in spaceflight encode proteins targeted back to the nucleus whereas most downregulated proteins in spaceflight are plastids localized. Cytosolic proteins are most upregulated in spaceflight, whereas transcripts encoding nucleus-targeted proteins are most upregulated (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">

The BRIC LED hardware, with integrated LED illumination, provides the growing seedlings with a source of light. Hence, plants growing in the BRIC LED hardware on ISS will have light cues but lack gravitational cues. This enabled us to study the effects of microgravity on plant transcriptome and organ-specific proteome, while also providing insight into how the plant root and shoot individually integrate light signaling in the absence of gravity. Evidence from this study suggests that the operations of the photosynthetic machinery (PSII and PSI) were greatly impacted in spaceflight (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">

</xref>), with the plant shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner to adapt to the microgravity environment. While the net photosynthetic rate might not be affected in microgravity as it was not captured in this study, the molecular functions of the photosynthetic apparatus, as revealed by this study, were impacted. The abundance of the NusG-like proteins (PTAC12, PTAC14, PTAC3, PTAC4) in the shoot and NusG-like proteins (PTAC16, PTAC14) in the root (<xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">
<bold>Supplementary Table D</bold>
</xref>) suggests attempts at boosting the translational efficiency of chloroplast ribosomes to reduce the plant sensitivity to environmental stress in spaceflight. The abundance of D1 complex protein (PSBA) and the PPL1 in spaceflight suggests attempts to optimize the water-oxidizing reaction and repair damages to the PSII. Reduced abundance of the PSAB and PSAE isoforms of the PSI in spaceflight, signifies an increased susceptibility of the PSII to photoinhibition (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Krieger-Liszkay et&#160;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ji et&#160;al., 2022</xref>) and a deficiency of the PSI steady state redox-level and re-oxidation. The PPL1, which was abundant in spaceflight in both organs, works to facilitate the assembly of PSII and optimize plant fitness under increased sensitivity to the BRIC LED hardware light.</p><p>Suppression of the PSI electron transport subunit protein, PETH, in spaceflight, is associated with reduced efficiency of the electron transport chain and instability of the PSI. However, this reduced efficiency is compensated for by an increased abundance of chloroplast gene translations (PTACs), which helps to prevent over-reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The reduced abundance of PSII proximal antennae protein cp43 (PSBC) and the light-harvesting chlorophyll complexes (LHCB1, LHCB4, LHCB5, LHCB6) in spaceflight suggest an attempt to decrease light harvest by the photosystems, hence decrease photoinhibition, increase the oxygen-evolving capability and improve repair to PSII. Varying degrees of molecular perturbations to the plant photosystem complexes in spaceflight have earlier been reported, which further validate our findings (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Stutte et&#160;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Wang, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink et&#160;al., 2019</xref>). However, unlike in this current study, where PSII and PSI complexes transcripts (RNA) were upregulated in spaceflight, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink et&#160;al. (2019)</xref> reported significant downregulation of transcripts enriched in photosynthetic pathways in spaceflight compared to ground samples. They also indicated the downregulation of four RNA transcripts associated with photosynthetic electron transport (petE: plastocyanin, petF: ferredoxin, petH: ferredoxin&#8211;NADP+ reductase, petJ: cytochrome c6). These transcripts were however upregulated in spaceflight in our current study, but they were all downregulated at the proteome level in both the plant root and shoot (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">
<bold>Figure&#160;4</bold>
</xref>). These discrepancies at the transcript level may be due to the difference in Arabidopsis wildtype ecotypes and spaceflight hardware utilized in both experiments.

<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Wang (2016)</xref> delineated another tangent by revealing that out of 38 photosystem-associated proteins that exhibited differential expression in spaceflight-grown rice seedlings, 34 were downregulated in spaceflight compared to Earth controls. While our findings and that of <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Vandenbrink et&#160;al.

Of course, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chen and Wang (2016)</xref> study was carried out on Rice seedlings, not Arabidopsis and directly extrapolating the differential PS I and PSII findings to Arabidopsis might not be so efficient. However, a consensus is that the spaceflight environment leads to a reduction in the PS I and PSII complexes, which may be accompanied by reduced photosynthetic efficiency and consequent smaller plant tissues.</p><p>The expression of the photosynthesis-associated proteins in the root might be due to the architecture of the BRIC LED hardware, which places the LEDs in close proximity to the roots, making them prone to direct hit by light. Interestingly, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#160;al. (2013)</xref> also reported the expression of several genes involved in light regulation in Arabidopsis roots in spaceflight transcriptomics experiments, even when the roots were not in close proximity to light. This phenomenon was also observed by <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Kruse et&#160;al. (2020)</xref> in their whole seedling transcriptomics study, despite that the seedlings were grown in the total absence of light cue in spaceflight. Hence, it is suggested that when gravity is absent, plant roots rely more heavily on negative phototropism for navigation, inducing light-sensing &#8220;tools&#8221; in roots in the spaceflight environment (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#160;al., 2017</xref>). The proteome landscape of the root and shoot, however, differs significantly in spaceflight, suggesting different adaptation mechanisms to the space environment, a further confirmation of <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#160;al.

A combined translatome-proteome study approach will be useful to elucidate this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="s4_2"><label>4.2</label><title>Intracellular trafficking and cell wall synthesis in spaceflight</title><p>Plants, throughout their evolutionary history, have developed remarkable adaptations to counteract the unrelenting force of gravity (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Medina et&#160;al., 2021</xref>). To withstand the gravitational force, plants have to ensure a balance between the internal turgor pressure, mediated by intracellular trafficking, and tensile resistance of both the primary and secondary cell walls. One pivotal molecular insight is the potential shift in cellulose metabolism in spaceflight, as indicated by the heightened abundance of Endoglucanase 20. Enhanced cellulose degradation might be a strategic adaptation, possibly optimizing cell wall flexibility in response to the unique stresses of a microgravity environment. This could be complemented by shifts in cellular adhesion dynamics, given the altered levels of FASCICLIN-LIKE ARABINOGALACTAN PROTEINs. The implications of these shifts could range from altered tissue integrity to modifications in intercellular communication. In a comprehensive transcriptomics meta-analysis of Arabidopsis plants cultivated in spaceflight within the BRIC Petri-dish fixation unit (PDFU) hardware, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et&#160;al. (2017)</xref> highlighted potential alterations in the cell wall matrix of plants in spaceflight, as revealed by the glycomics evaluation of the BRIC-16-Cyt samples. They implied that microgravity influences the biosynthesis of xylan and pectic elements, leading to variations in the composition of the cell wall matrix.</p><p>Alongside this, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Johnson et&#160;al. (2017)</xref> also reported the reduced abundance of xylan and pectic epitopes in spaceflight-grown plants, which resonate with our findings, highlighting the potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides in spaceflight conditions, particularly in the root. <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Nakashima et&#160;al. (2023)</xref> in their novel glycome profiling and immunohistochemistry of Arabidopsis in spaceflight also observed that roots from spaceflight Arabidopsis seedlings displayed a generally increased labeling intensity when targeted with xyloglucan monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) compared to ground controls. They concluded that the heightened fluorescence intensity post-labeling with xyloglucan mAbs might result from changes in polysaccharide biosynthesis and secretion due to microgravity conditions. <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Wakabayashi et&#160;al. (2020)</xref> in their studies on Rice seedling cell wall under spaceflight conditions indicated that microgravity reduces the 1,3:1,4-&#946;-glucan content in rice shoot cell walls, implicating an increase in the expression of an endo-1,3:1,4-&#946;-glucanase gene. This reduction might serve to keep the cell wall more flexible under microgravity conditions. This observation is in harmony with our data, revealing potential changes in the biosynthesis of cell wall non-cellulosic polysaccharides, in spaceflight environments. Interestingly, while these studies reported that glucan metabolism is impacted, the spaceflight environment (microgravity) seems to exert minimal influence on the metabolism of arabinoxylans. This differentiation in response indicates a level of specificity in how plants adjust their cell wall components in response to altered gravity.</p><p>In the absence of gravity, seedlings have to default to secondary signals such as other environmental impulses. This affects internal homeostasis, inter- and intra-cellular transports, and cell wall composition. Our results identified intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport as a major player in adaptation to microgravity in both root and shoot. This is characterized by the increased abundance of the vacuolar proton ATPases and calcium-transporting ATPases. The vacuolar ATPases, contributing to the cytosolic pH homeostasis, form electrochemical proton gradients and drive active transport into cell organelles and they are important targets of phosphorylation and redox modification. The root-specific abundance of the cation transporters suggests that the homeostatic needs of the root differ from that of the shoot in spaceflight. The altered abundance of small GTPases such as Ran, Rab, and Ras, between spaceflight and Earth suggests a functional dysregulation of vesicle trafficking in spaceflight. The spaceflight environment alters molecular switches between the membrane-bound active GTP and cytosolic inactive GDP which tremendously affects signal transduction.</p><p>Molecular mechanisms driving polar auxin distribution were affected and organ-specific, with the altered abundance of auxin transporters in spaceflight and on Earth. However, auxin transport and response appear to be more pronounced on Earth than in microgravity. Results from this study also suggest a decreased stability of the cellulose cell wall in spaceflight, due to the abundance of cellulose-degrading proteins and less abundance of cellulose synthase (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">
<bold>Table&#160;2</bold>
</xref>). The spaceflight environment led to the decreased formation and increased destabilization of the microtubules which suggests that seedlings seem to fall back on the actin skeleton for support. Interactions between PIP2 which is abundant in space, with VILLINs which were also abundant in space inhibit the capping and severing actions of actin but rather increase actin binding at the headpiece region. This suggests that actin cross-nucleation and cross-linking is an adaptation mechanism for plants in space. An in-depth study into vesicle and cargo sorting under microgravity will give more insight into how plants adapt their intracellular trafficking and cell wall depositions to the spaceflight environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4_3"><label>4.3</label><title>Spaceflight significantly affects plant translation machinery in an organ-specific pattern</title><p>The varied abundance of over 150 ribosomal subunit proteins, spliceosomes and proteasomes in spaceflight and across both organs suggest major alterations to plant transcriptional and translation machinery as an adaptation mechanism to the spaceflight environment (<xref rid="SM2" ref-type="supplementary-material">

</xref>). The decreased abundance of various mRNA slicing factors (ATO, CUV, SC35, SCL30A, U2AF65A, U2AF65B, DEAH3) in the shoot in spaceflight suggests less mRNA splicing in the shoot compared to the root, which might lead to the abundance of non-functional proteins in the shoot and increased need for proteasome activities. Combining transcript data with this proteome data will give more insight into this. The abundance of HEAT SHOCK PROTEIN families (HS60, HSP70, HSP90) in both organs suggests an increased control of protein homeostasis in space characterized by folding of nascent polypeptides released from the ribosome, sorting of proteins to cell organelles and providing a link to the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. The relative abundance of 26S proteasomes involved in the degradation of misfolded and orphaned proteins suggests that the spaceflight environment led to errors in protein translation, hence the need to increase the efficiency of the proteasome unit.</p></sec><sec id="s4_4"><label>4.4</label><title>Combating oxidative stress while maintaining ROS signaling in spaceflight</title><p>Seedlings in spaceflight are faced with the need to maintain a balance between the abundance of ROS for systemic stress signaling and their damaging effects. Our results suggest dedicated efforts to the removal of superoxide radicals by the abundance of several peroxides, thioredoxin, ferritin, and superoxide dismutase in spaceflight. We infer that plants in spaceflight utilize a shunt pathway, which is a parallel alternative to the glycolytic pathway, to complement the NADPH production from the pentose-phosphate pathway. The pentose-phosphate shunt pathway is driven by NADPH demands in different tissues (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Aziz and Mohiuddin, 2022</xref>), and in this extremity, plants in spaceflight recycle inorganic phosphate from intracellular phosphate metabolites in the vacuole, mediated by PAP26 to meet the NADPH demands. This suggests that the metabolic energy requirement for plants in space is higher than on Earth. The abundance of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and several glutathione dehydrogenases suggests the involvement of the S-nitrosation reaction in cellular homeostasis in spaceflight. A common feature of the ALDHs is the susceptibility of their catalytic cysteine residue to GSNO-mediated S-nitrosation (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Stiti et&#160;al., 2020</xref>), which has been suggested as a central gravitropism signaling event (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Kruse and Wyatt, 2022</xref>).</p><p>While this study substantiates that the BRIC LED hardware supports Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight, it is important to note that the BRIC hardware, unlike some newly developed advanced spaceflight hardware such as the Advance Plant Habitat (APH), is a closed system, hence no gas exchange between the plant and the external environment. This is a major limitation for the hardware, as this promotes the buildup of gases such as ethylene, oxygen and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Klymchuk et&#160;al., 2003</xref>). Despite being an important hormone to plant, elevated ethylene level had been identified to cause anomalous Arabidopsis plant growth in spaceflight (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stankovic, 2018</xref>) and sterility in male wheat plants grown in spaceflight (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Campbell et&#160;al., 2001</xref>). Beyond ethylene, the accumulation of oxygen and other VOCs can potentially reach toxic levels in the BRIC LED hardware. This is a substantial source of stress as indicated by <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Basu et&#160;al. (2017)</xref>. Drawing parallels with Earth, closed environments like terrariums might encounter similar challenges with gas accumulation. However, there&#8217;s a critical difference. On Earth, natural processes and microbial interactions often intervene to balance out the system over time. But in the unique microgravity setting of space, these natural balancing acts might not function as they do here, thereby amplifying the challenges of a closed system, as we consider plants for bio-regenerative life support in long-term spaceflight missions.</p></sec><sec id="s4_5"><label>4.5</label><title>Non-correlated transcriptome and proteome: indicative of post-transcriptional regulation in spaceflight?</title><p>Spaceflight environmental conditions pose unique challenges to plants, leading to significant alterations in gene expression and protein synthesis.

The observed non-correlation between transcriptome and proteome data from Arabidopsis plants grown in spaceflight may indeed suggest a prevalent post-transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#160;al., 2022</xref>). Transcript-protein discordance can be attributed to multiple factors. One such factor is the differential extraction protocols and data processing for RNA and protein, which can introduce variation in the extracted quantities (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Liu et&#160;al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, due to the unique environmental stressors of spaceflight, the mechanisms to arrest translation could be compromised, resulting in skewed protein synthesis rates. Moreover, the phenomenon of alternative splicing, often upregulated under stress conditions, can result in multiple protein isoforms from a single transcript, further complicating the correlation. Another source of discordance to note is that the RNA transcriptome might be a reflection of the plant&#8217;s immediate response to stress, while the proteome represents a more stabilized, adaptive response. These unique constraints of spaceflight can thus evoke distinct reactions at plants&#8217; transcriptome and proteome levels, leading to non-correlated outcomes. Hence, attributing the non-correlation of the transcriptome and proteome only to alternative splicing will be a bias.</p><p>This study, by combining transcriptomics and proteomics, provided insight into plants&#8217; adaptive responses to the spaceflight environment at multiple molecular levels. While we did not directly measure photosynthetic net production, our findings indicate a series of modifications to photosystems II and I aimed at adapting to the space environment, potentially decreasing the plant&#8217;s sensitivity to light intensity and enhancing its oxygen-evolving capacity. Concurrently, we observed evidence for an increased metabolic energy requirement in spaceflight, with plants seemingly engaging alternate energy generation pathways to complement photosynthetic production. Furthermore, our findings indicate significant impacts on cellular trafficking and potential compromises to cell wall integrity, suggesting an adaptation in structural support provided by actin filament cross-linking and cross-nucleation. This research not only serves as a comprehensive study of plant response in spaceflight but also holds profound implications for terrestrial agriculture, providing valuable insights for developing crop varieties resilient to environmental stressors on Earth, such as drought, extreme temperatures, and salinity.</p><p>This study also contributes to the broader goal of space agriculture &#8211;&#160;a key component of long-duration space missions and off-Earth colonization. While centered around the model plant Arabidopsis, our findings could provide the foundation for developing crop varieties suitable for growth in extraterrestrial environments, supporting food production for future missions to Mars and the Moon. Thus, the findings of our research, while intrinsically fascinating, also bear practical implications for the future of both terrestrial and space agriculture. As we continue to explore the final frontier, understanding how life &#8211; in this case, plant life &#8211; adapts and thrives is crucial for the success of our extraterrestrial endeavors and the sustainable development of our agriculture on Earth.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
