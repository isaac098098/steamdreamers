Capabilities were developed to perform experiments in low earth orbit with on-board sample recovery, thereby avoiding complications caused by return to Earth. For NASA&#8217;s Rodent Research-1 mission, female mice (ten 32 wk C57BL/6NTac; ten 16 wk C57BL/6J) were launched on an unmanned vehicle, then resided on the International Space Station for 21/22d or 37d in microgravity. Mice were euthanized on-orbit, livers and spleens dissected, and remaining tissues frozen <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic> for later analyses. Mice appeared healthy by daily video health checks and body, adrenal, and spleen weights of 37d-flight (FLT) mice did not differ from ground controls housed in flight hardware (GC), while thymus weights were 35% greater in FLT than GC. Mice exposed to 37d of spaceflight displayed elevated liver mass (33%) and select enzyme activities compared to GC, whereas 21/22d-FLT mice did not. FLT mice appeared more physically active than respective GC while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy. RNA and enzyme activity levels in tissues recovered on-orbit were of acceptable quality. Thus, this system establishes a new capability for conducting long-duration experiments in space, enables sample recovery on-orbit, and avoids triggering standard indices of chronic stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Microarray analysis</kwd><kwd>Ageing</kwd><kwd>Homeostasis</kwd><kwd>Translational research</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>NASA, Space Biology Program and ISS Program, U.S.Government</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Space travel over the past five decades reveals that multiple organ systems are influenced by novel environmental conditions above the Earth&#8217;s surface. In addition to reduced gravitational acceleration, spaceflight confers other unique environmental challenges including confinement in a closed environment, altered gas composition and exposure to space radiation, each of which has the potential to have physiological effects. Protecting humans in space requires a clear understanding of the myriad of physiologic changes that can occur in response to these exposures and their associated medical risks. As on Earth, experimentation with rodents in space enables detailed exploration of physiology and mechanisms, as well as potential mitigation strategies using experimental approaches that are not possible with humans as subjects. All but two spaceflight rodent experiments, prior to the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission described here, have entailed sample collection only after return to Earth. In fact, some of the observed consequences of spaceflight on tissue structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and gene expression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> can be attributed to forces related to return and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery, rather than to habitation in space per se. Therefore, there is a pressing need for spaceflight hardware and operational systems to further explore the consequences of long duration space travel on rodents, while avoiding the confounding variables introduced by reentry and return of the animals to Earth.</p><p id="Par3">Previous Russian Cosmos and NASA Space Shuttle missions provided multiple opportunities to perform rodent experiments up to three weeks in duration, which contributed to our current understanding of how mammals adapt to the space environment. Rodent Space Shuttle experiments conducted between 1965 and 2011 demonstrated extensive changes in the immune, musculoskeletal, and central nervous and cardiovascular systems, as well as endocrine, hematologic and metabolic changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, although results between missions were sometimes inconsistent. Various independent variables such as strain, age, and duration may account for at least some of the mixed results obtained between different experiments; however, the relatively short duration of all Shuttle missions is likely to be a major factor explaining the discrepancies. Tissues adapt dynamically and at different rates to the allostatic load imposed in the course of a prolonged spaceflight experiment, which entails introduction into a novel flight hardware caging environment, launch, habitation in microgravity, then typically reentry and ambulation on Earth prior to sample recovery.</p><p id="Par4">There also have been a limited number of long duration (&gt;3 wk), rodent spaceflight experiments. A recent unmanned, Russian biosatellite experiment (Bion M1) that entailed sample recovery after return to Earth revealed that 30 days of spaceflight caused muscle, thymus and spleen atrophy (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> deficits in structure of various skeletal elements (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>), altered structural morphology and changes in gene expression of several tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The lengthy interval (13&#8201;hr) between capsule reentry and sample recovery for the Bion M1 mission may have affected at least some of these findings. The longest duration experiment with rodents in space completed to date (91d) in the European Space Agency&#8217;s Mouse Drawer System<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> revealed intriguing differences in oxidative damage to red blood cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and skeletal decrements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, although this experiment had a limited sample size. Recently, the Japanese Space Agency performed important experiments with a newly developed flight hardware system supporting singly-housed mice, which can be centrifuged at 1&#8201;g to replace Earth&#8217;s gravity level while on the ISS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Findings from their experiments reveal that 1&#8201;g artificial gravity mitigates the expected bone loss and muscle atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> as well as retinal changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> that occur after long duration microgravity. Each of the various flight hardware systems developed for long duration spaceflight has unique features, which have the potential to influence results obtained (Table&#160;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Rodent hardware utilized by space agencies.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Space Agency</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Hardware</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Maximum # of mice per chamber</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Cameras</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">unique features</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MHU (Mouse Habitat Unit)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">12 cages per unit; each cage accommodates 1 mouse</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">centrifuge compatible, smooth walls to limit ambulation, temperature sensor, crew can access animals on orbit</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Italian Space Agency</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">MDS (Mouse Drawer System)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">6 individually (max) or in groups (4 pairs)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">temperature, humidity, CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> control system, smooth walls to limit ambulation, crew can access animals on orbit</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP), Russian Academy of Sciences</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Bion-M1 Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya (BOS)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">3</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">temperature, humidity, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> controlled system, smooth walls to limit ambulation</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">AEM (Animal Enclosure Module)</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">up to 10 mice or 5 rats</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">No</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">no sensors for temperature and humidity, metal grid walls, layered filter system, interior lighting, crew can access animals on orbit</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">NASA</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rodent Habitat</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">up to 10 mice (5 per side); 5&#8211;6 rats</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Yes</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">metal grid walls, temperature and humidity sensors, long duration filter for improved odor containment, LED lighting (day), infrared lighting (night), crew can access animals on orbit</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>A brief description of rodent hardware, and its features and capabilities, utilized by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, Italian Space Agency, Institute of Biomedical Problems/Russian Academy of Sciences, and NASA.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par5">The main goal of RR-1 was to establish new capabilities for conducting reliable and reproducible long duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Important objectives included monitoring animal health and welfare, and recovering samples of sufficiently high quality for global gene expression analysis using current demanding methods. The RR-1 flight experiment consisted of two separate studies with a total of 20 mice; one NASA Validation study (10 mice) and one ISS National Lab Experimental study (10 mice). The NASA Validation study was designed to evaluate the capaibilities of the rodent hardware, on-orbit operations, and sample retrieval for conducting high quality rodent expeirments consistent with current standards. The Experimental study was sponsored by the ISS National Lab on behalf of Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, and was designed to determine spaceflight effects on muscle atrophy in MuRF1 knockout (KO) mice and wild type (WT) mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.

To accommodate unique aspects of the Dragon transport vehicle and the ISS, flight hardware was modified from the Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), that was used successfully in 27 missions with rats or mice aboard the Space Shuttle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> followed by multiple RR missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The RR-1 validation mission launched adult, female mice to low earth orbit in an unmanned Dragon capsule on SpaceX-4, then after 4 days the RR-1 mice were transferred to the International Space Station (ISS) where they resided for up to 33 days (total 37 days in microgravity). Female mice were selected for this mission for two reasons: first, because only female mice were flown on earlier missions that used the heritage AEM group-housed hardware system, and second, to avoid potential complications due to aggression which is more common in males than females. After this first Validation mission, pre-flight experiments were performed to optimize conditions for acclimating males in group-housed conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and subsequently flight experiments were conducted successfully with males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Important aspects of the study design included use of adult animals, a cage system that enabled purposeful locomotion of the animals throughout the habitat, and measurements of basic indices of animal health that were compromised in past spaceflight experiments. Animal health and behavior were monitored by daily downlinked video, and samples were dissected both on-orbit by astronauts and after return to Earth from frozen carcasses. Subsequently, tissue samples were distributed to multiple scientists across the world for detailed analyses. We found mice thrived in the housing, as assessed by behavior, body weights and organ mass (adrenal, thymus, spleen). Further, samples dissected on-orbit yielded high quality RNA and protein (select liver enzyme activities). Recovery of livers dissected from frozen carcasses yielded RNA with high RIN values, although further work is needed to determine conclusively if transcriptional profiles are the same in livers freshly dissected on orbit compared to livers recovered post-flight from frozen carcasses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par9">Mice flown on the RR-1 mission were designated as either NASA &#8220;Validation&#8221; mice (Female C57BL/6J, 16 wks) or ISS National Lab &#8220;Experimental&#8221; mice (Female C57BL/6NTac, 32 wks) to achieve the main objectives.

All animals were healthy throughout the duration of the mission as evidenced by daily video health checks, maintenance of body weights compared with ground controls, and an absence of immune organ atrophy (thymus, spleen) or adrenal hypertrophy relative to ground controls. As expected, the mass of the soleus, consisting predominantly of type I muscle fibers which typically atrophy with disuse, was significantly lower in Validation FLT mice than in GC mice housed in the flight hardware (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), whereas other muscles did not. Further, we found that all of the forms of tissue collection/preservation tested (on-orbit dissection followed by freezing, preservation in RNAlater, or freezing carcasses on-orbit followed by dissecting tissues and organs from frozen carcasses after they were returned to Earth) provided samples with high enough quality for molecular analyses, although the tissue collection/preservation methods may have affected results obtained.

We found Validation FLT mice had similar body mass as a consequence of spaceflight when compared to GC and Viv mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This finding is in contrast to previous reports from numerous rodent spaceflight experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Some previous spaceflight experiments have on occasion shown that spaceflight can lead to reduced body weights compared to baseline values and ground controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, complicating interpretation of the results obtained. If the body weight loss is due to persistent stress response entailing activation of the HPA (hypothalamic, pituitary and adrenal) axis, then it can be difficult to distinguish between effects of reduced gravity-dependent loading in space vs. endocrine stress. These findings, together with similar findings from tissue weights of adrenal gland, thymus and spleen and behavioral observations, are consistent with the interpretation that habitation on-orbit did not provoke a chronic stress response.</p><p id="Par25">Both the Validation and Experimental FLT mice engaged in more active behaviors than their respective GC mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). This finding was surprising but consistent with a recent report that simulated weightlessness (14d) also leads to increased locomotion relative to ambulatory controls after a transient initial period of reduced motor activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the Validation FLT mice exhibited a rapid, repetitive running behavior, which was not observed in the Experimental mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

Consistent with previous studies, we observed a ~19% decrement in soleus weight in Validation FLT mice compared to GC (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), but no differences in the EDL.

The lack of atrophy in the gastrocnemius was especially surprising since C57BL/6 female mice (9 weeks old at launch) utilized in previous space shuttle experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> housed in very similar hardware to that used in this study, showed significant atrophy of gastrocnemious, soleus and tibialis anterior. Interestingly, these mice were shown to lose body mass with spaceflight compared with basal controls despite their relatively young age and expected growth pattern.

GC sample collection and storage was conducted to duplicate the on-orbit procedures (including dissection timing, preservation and storage) with the highest fidelity possible. Enzyme activities from livers of Experimental FLT mice that were dissected and preserved on-orbit and from livers of GC mice, were similar to those of samples prepared under optimal laboratory conditions, as well as protocols for GC sample collection and storage that were specifically planned to duplicate on-orbit procedures, including dissection timing and preservation.</p><p id="Par31">The RNA extracted from livers that were dissected then immediately frozen on-orbit were compared with those dissected from the frozen carcasses. RNA from livers, either freshly dissected or from carcasses, exhibited RIN values that exceeded 6.5 (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). RIN values for spleens that were dissected then preserved in RNAlater (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8C</xref>) exceeded &gt;7.5. RNA recovered from frozen spleens in preflight experiments consistently yielded RNA with very low RIN values, possibly due to higher RNase expression in this organ (results not shown); therefore this approach for sample recovery was not used on the flight samples. Taken together, findings from the liver tissue indicate that both methods of spaceflight tissue preservation were sufficient to yield RNA with RIN values generally considered adequate for most molecular analyses although possible differences in patterns of gene expression assessed by RTqPCR require further evaluation to determine if recovery from frozen carcasses yields unreliable results, perhaps due to warm ischemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> in liver samples recovered from the carcasses (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Studies are in progress to further assess this possibility.</p><p id="Par32">Conducting spaceflight experiments presents unique challenges to making rapid progress in understanding the biological responses of rodents to microgravity. Not the least of these challenges is ensuring that control animals on Earth are provided a physical environment that replicates the environment on the spacecraft to the greatest extent possible. One limit of this study, as opposed to some prior spaceflight missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> is that ground controls were not subjected to the vibration, acceleration and noise stimuli which is unavoidable during launch of rodents into space. This was due to logistical and cost limitations imposed on this system. We reasoned, though, that because the system was intended to support long duration experiments, the effects of transient stressors associated with launch would diminish by the time of sample recovery. Further study is needed to justify this expectation, especially for those tissue responses which are most likely to be sensitive to the stress of launch. Further, unique habitats and environmental control systems must be devised to adequately support both FLT and GC animals. The hardware developed to transport and house the mice did in fact display differences; we found GC values for several parameters were different than Viv, as others also have found using the heritage habitat, AEM, on Shuttle missions (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>).

We suggest a second, long duration (&gt;2&#8211;3 wk) phase follows when the animals have acclimated to reduced loading microgravity; our findings that body weights, immune organ mass and adrenal mass were not lower in Validation spaceflight mice compared to ground controls or basal groups support this proposal. Return to earth would be expected to introduce a new phase when the effects of gravity-dependent loading exceeds the new steady-state achieved during residence in microgravity. Since the first mission described here, the hardware system and operations for this project were developed further to support return to Earth of living animals, enabling study of the entire cycle of long duration space travel. Although there are individual variabilities, similar phases of adaptation to spaceflight are seen in crew members.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Hardware description and performance</title><p id="Par35">The Rodent Research Transporter and Habitats performed as expected for the duration of the flight.

For Validation mice, uniformity of variance was tested by Levene&#8217;s test and normality goodness of fit by Shapiro-Wilk. One-factor ANOVA was then applied to the data, and if the main effect showed P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05, was followed by a Tukey-Kramer HSD post hoc analysis. The sole exception to application of ANOVA was Validation liver catalase activity, which did not display normal distribution. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to Validation catalase results. P&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05 was accepted as significant. All data shown are mean +/&#8722; S.D.
