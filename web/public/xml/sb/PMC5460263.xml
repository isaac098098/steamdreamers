</p><p>We previously used the RWV to establish highly differentiated 3-D intestinal organotypic models derived from human epithelial cell lines and demonstrated their ability to predict in vivo infection outcomes and <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> pathogenic mechanisms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> While initiated from a single cell type, these epithelial models spontaneously differentiated into multiple epithelial cell types normally found in the intestine, including enterocytes, goblet cells, Paneth cells, and M/M-like cells, while exhibiting extensive tight junction formation, apical-basolateral polarity, and mucin production. Following infection with <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, these 3-D epithelial models exhibited phenotypes consistent with in vivo infections in animals and humans, including alterations in tissue morphology, adherence, invasion, apoptosis, and production of cytokines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> Moreover, <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium invaded 3-D intestinal cells independently of all known <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> type three secretion systems, i.e. SPI-1, SPI-2, and the flagellar secretory system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> a major finding that paralleled in vivo infection observations in both animals and humans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and challenged the paradigm established by 2-D monolayers that SPI-1 is always required for invasion of intestinal epithelium. Similar results were recently reported using a 3-D intestinal organoid model derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells, which showed that a Typhimurium <italic toggle="yes">invA</italic> mutant was still able to invade into the model, albeit at lower levels than the wild type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of 3-D tissue models in predicting in vivo-like pathogenic mechanisms.</p><p>These results led us to postulate that our 3-D intestinal epithelial model could serve as a high fidelity platform for engineering an improved version able to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity normally encountered by <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> during enteric infection. We focused on the addition of macrophages, as they are a key immune cell type targeted by <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> during infection, and intracellular survival in these cells is essential for the virulence of this pathogen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> While in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that macrophages may contribute to <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>-host specificity and are able to distinguish between the closely related pathovars Typhimurium and Typhi, these studies have shown inconsistent trends, likely due to differences in experimental design and implementation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> This area of study is of keen interest given the devastating epidemic of invasive multidrug resistant non-typhoidal <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> (iNTS) infections in sub-Saharan Africa linked to a genetically distinct sequence type (ST) of <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. Typhimurium, ST313, which has undergone genome degradation similar to that of host-adapted <italic toggle="yes">S</italic>. Typhi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>
<italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium is classified as a generalist in terms of its host specificity, causing disease in a wide range of hosts, including humans. While usually associated with self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhimurium can cause serious systemic infection in the immunocompromised. Conversely, <italic toggle="yes">S.</italic> Typhi is a human-specific pathogen that causes systemic illness and typhoid fever.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Thus, there is concern that ST313 may be evolving toward a human-specific adaptation similar to Typhi. However, very limited information is available regarding host-pathogen interaction characteristics and host specificity of ST313, although recent studies using ST313 strain <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link> found that it causes invasive disease in animals and lethal disease in mice, indicating it is not a human-specific pathovar.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>
</p><p>Herein, we report advancement of our previously developed 3-D HT-29 intestinal epithelial model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> into a multicellular, co-culture model that provides additional complexity relevant to the intestinal microenvironment by incorporation of immune competent cells; specifically, functional macrophages. As 3-D intestinal epithelial models have been repeatedly shown to better mimic the differentiated structure/function of intestinal tissues, and respond in a more in vivo-like manner to challenge with enteric pathogens than 2-D monolayers, our comparisons in this study thus focused on the 3-D co-culture and epithelial models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> Morphological and immunohistochemical analysis of the HT-29-U937 co-culture model revealed key in vivo-like structural and functional characteristics. To assess the impact of macrophages in this new co-culture model and validate its application as a human surrogate infection platform, we applied it to characterize infection profiles between closely related <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella enterica</italic> pathovars with different disease phenotypes and host tropisms (Typhimurium strains SL1344 and ST313 <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link>, and Typhi strain Ty2). To further enhance the physiological relevance of the study, bacteria were cultured under aerobic or microaerobic conditions prior to infection, as <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> must adapt to a broad range of oxygen levels during its normal life cycle both before and after entry into the host. This includes aerobic conditions prior to ingestion, anaerobic conditions in the lumen, and microaerobic conditions approaching the intestinal wall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Our studies revealed that the 3-D co-culture model could discriminate between <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> pathovars and represents an innovative model for host-specific testing that can bridge knowledge gaps between 3-D epithelial models and in vivo studies to study host-pathogen interactions and unveil infectious disease mechanisms.</p><p>To our knowledge, this work represents the first RWV-derived 3-D co-culture model of intestinal epithelium and macrophages.

The microcarrier bead scaffolds used for culturing 3-D cells resulted in establishment of an &#8220;inside-out&#8221; intestinal model, wherein the luminal side of the cells faces the culture media, which facilitates access of <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> to the host-pathogen interface naturally encountered during intestinal infection. Cells are attached to ECM-coated porous beads through their basal surface and are in contact with the external milieu at their apical surface, which is relevant to the architecture of the parental tissue. In order to develop the novel 3-D co-culture model, we had to design and optimize several experimental parameters including order of addition and ratio of the two cell types (HT-29 and U937) and the activation state of U937 cells upon addition to the model. We found that the addition of U937 cells to a partially or fully established 3-D epithelial model did not result in adequate incorporation of the U937 cells into the model, nor did it allow for the U937 cells to be incorporated beneath or within the epithelium, as would be relevant to the in vivo scenario. In addition, although we previously found that the addition of U937 monocytes to a 3-D alveolar epithelial lung model naturally stimulated their activation into functional macrophages,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> we did not find this to be the case when these same cells were added to our 3-D colon model in our current study. Thus, we decided to pre-bind the U937 cells to the collagen I-coated microcarrier beads and activate using PMA. Following PMA removal, the cell-bead complexes were introduced into the RWV bioreactor together with the HT-29 cells. Using this optimized procedure, we found that immunofluorescence profiling revealed the presence of differentiated intestinal epithelial cells as well as macrophages, the latter of which were integrated both between epithelial cells and underneath the epithelium (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We then attempted to enumerate the ratio of epithelial cells to macrophages within the final model; however, we were unable to successfully remove U937 cells from the microcarrier beads using either trypsin, collagenase or a combination of the two enzymes.<fig id="Fig2" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>3-D co-culture model validation. <bold>A</bold> Adherens and tight junction markers &#946;-catenin (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) and ZO-1 (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>g</bold>); mucin markers MUC5AC (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>h</bold>) and MUC2 (<bold>d</bold>, <bold>i</bold>); and M cell marker Sialyl Lewis A (<bold>e</bold>, <bold>j</bold>) shown in <italic toggle="yes">green</italic>.

The key advancement made in this work was the incorporation of phagocytic macrophages into the epithelial model in order to more closely approximate in vivo multicellular complexity, architecture and function. This is an important feature, as the gastrointestinal mucosa contains the largest population of tissue macrophages in the body, which play a critical role in protecting the host from pathogens, including <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> A previous study reported the incorporation of lymphocytes into a 3-D RWV intestinal epithelial model for enteric infection; however macrophages were not included in the model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>
</p><p>When we applied both our 3-D co-culture and epithelial models to evaluate the colonization profiles of distinct <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> pathovars, we found that the presence of macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model had an inhibitory effect on the adherence, invasion and survival of all strains evaluated relative to the epithelial model, which contained epithelial cells only (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). This inhibition could be due to an overall increased resistance to colonization as a result of cross talk between the epithelial cells and the macrophages or increased killing of the bacteria by the macrophages and/or epithelial cells. In either scenario, these findings are in alignment with the known role of macrophages in vivo to protect the host against enteric pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> and further emphasize the important role of immune cells in the early interactions between the pathogen and host.</p><p>We also found that Typhi adhered to the 3-D epithelial model at much higher levels than the Typhimurium strains (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). This enhanced adherence was eliminated when the same strains were used to infect the 3-D co-culture model (epithelial cells plus macrophages), with the Ty2 adherence significantly more impacted by the presence of macrophages in the co-culture model than NTS strains <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link> and SL1344 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">S3, panel B</xref>). Previous monolayer studies using a single host cell type (epithelial cells or macrophages) have produced conflicting results regarding the differences in colonization between Typhi and Typhimurium, with some studies reporting that Typhimurium adheres and invades at higher levels than Typhi and others finding the precise opposite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> Genomic comparisons between Typhi and Typhimurium have revealed discrete differences between the two serovars in genes known to be important for bacterial adherence, including fimbrial and Vi capsule genes (the latter specific to Typhi).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> While some studies have characterized the phenotypic impact of those differences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> the adherence and invasion mechanisms of Typhi are still not fully understood, due in part to the limits of the current experimental models for human-specific infectious diseases.

Thus the large decrease we observed in <italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> adherence to the 3-D co-culture model could potentially be due to changes in the expression and/or localization of surface receptors in the host that occurred with the inclusion of macrophages with the epithelial cells. It was shown previously that CFTR is an important receptor for Typhi.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> We hypothesized that the inclusion of activated macrophages in the 3-D co-culture model could lead to altered localization and/or expression of the CFTR receptor in a manner that could explain the drastic decrease in Typhi adherence between the epithelial and co-culture models relative to the Typhimurium serovars. However, under the conditions of this study we observed no differences by immunohistochemical profiling in its localization or expression between the two models. Another alterative explanation is that the Typhi strain was killed at higher levels than the NTS strains by the either the macrophages, the epithelial cells, or both.

Moreover, this enhanced invasion/uptake was only observed in the 3-D co-culture model, indicating that the macrophages play a key role in this increased invasion phenotype either directly through increased uptake of <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link> or indirectly through cross talk to the epithelium.

Regardless of the model being infected (3-D co-culture or epithelial), SL1344-infected cells were abundant in samples imaged at the intracellular survival/replication time point (24&#8201;h.p.i.), with the bacteria forming dense intracellular clusters within infected cells. <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link> formed more punctate patterns with occasional intracellular clustering and what appeared to be lower numbers of bacteria relative to SL1344- or Ty2-infected models.

When SL1344 was cultured aerobically, it was very difficult to locate any macrophages in the co-culture model at 24&#8201;h.p.i., suggesting that SL1344 may have induced apoptosis in these cells; a phenotype previously observed in SL1344-infected macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> In contrast, macrophages were found in <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link>- and Ty2-infected models, with both strains co-localizing with intestinal epithelial cells and macrophages when the bacteria were cultured aerobically.

Possible explanations for these infection patterns following culture of the bacteria under low oxygen conditions prior to infection include: (1) pathogen avoidance of macrophages, (2) specific targeting of epithelial cells, (3) enhanced intracellular killing within macrophages, and/or (4) a masking effect whereby the macrophages are unable to detect the pathogen, leading to lower levels of uptake. When we compared our co-culture imaging results at 24&#8201;h to the co-culture colonization data at the same time point (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>), both SL1344 and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-nucleotide" xlink:href="D23580">D23580</ext-link> displayed an ~2-fold decrease (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) in replication/survival when the bacteria were cultured under oxygen-limiting conditions relative to aerobic cultures.

Phagocytic macrophages were incorporated in the model in order to better recapitulate the multicellular complexity and structure of the parental tissue, thereby allowing for synergistic contributions of different cell types during infection to be assessed so that host-pathogen interactions can be studied in a more physiologically relevant context. In addition, we also demonstrated that this model could be used for investigations into the impact of different environmental parameters on colonization as well as co-localization patterns of pathogens with different host cell types. These findings emphasize the power of incorporating a series of related models with increasing complexity to study infectious disease mechanisms. Using this approach, we identified key microenvironmental factors (i.e., host multicellular complexity and oxygen) important for regulating pathovar-specific invasion and host co-localization properties. We continue to enhance the physiological relevance of these models by incorporation of additional cell types that are normally found in the tissue in vivo, including the use of primary cells, dendritic cells, B cells and T cells, which will continue to advance our mechanistic understanding of enteric infectious disease in the context of the host-microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Bacterial strains and growth conditions</title><p>

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) (10<sup>&#8722;8</sup>&#8201;M) was added to GTSF-2 to induce characteristics of terminally differentiated macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup> The mix was evenly distributed into 6-well plates and incubated for 48&#8201;h at 37&#8201;&#176;C, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Following incubation, PMA-differentiated U937 cells bound to microcarrier beads were gently rinsed with GTSF-2 media and combined with HT-29 cells (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup>). Cultures were loaded into the RWV, which was then filled completely with culture media, and bubbles removed. Cultures were incubated statically for 15&#8211;30&#8201;min. prior to initiating rotation (20&#8201;rpm), monitored daily and small bubbles removed if observed. GTSF-2 was replenished after the first 4&#8211;5 days and then every 24&#8201;h thereafter until the harvest of cultures at 15&#8211;16 days. The&#160;3-D HT-29 epithelial cultures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> served as controls and were grown in parallel with the 3-D co-culture model for all studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Bead uptake assays</title><p>The phagocytic activity of macrophages was assessed as previously described,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref></sup> based on uptake of bacteria-sized (2&#8201;&#181;M) Fluoresbrite YG Microspheres (Polysciences). Briefly, 3-D aggregates (2&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup> cells) of either the co-culture or epithelial model were incubated with 10<sup>8</sup> fluorescent beads for 30&#8201;min at 37&#8201;&#176;C and 10% CO<sub>2</sub> in 6-well plates (5&#8201;mL medium). Following incubation, the aggregates were rinsed in triplicate with cold Dulbecco&#8217;s Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS; Invitrogen) to remove non-phagocytosed beads and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Following a 30-minute incubation, aggregates were rinsed in triplicate with DPBS and further processed for imaging with CLSM as described below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Infection studies</title><p>Upon reaching optimal differentiation as determined by immunohistochemical profiling, 3-D cell culture models were harvested from the RWV, assayed for viability, and seeded into multi-well plates to a final density of ~1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup> cells/well. A gentamicin protection assay was then performed as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Briefly, bacteria were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 10. Samples were plated for viable CFU/mL for adherence (30&#8201;min), invasion (3&#8201;h) and intracellular survival (24&#8201;h). For each time point, host cells were washed 2&#8211;3 times with HBSS, lysed with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and serial dilutions of the lysate plated on LB agar to assess CFU per mL. Gentamicin was added after the 30-min (50&#8201;&#181;g/mL) and 3&#8201;h (10&#8201;&#181;g/mL) time points in order to eliminate remaining extracellular bacteria. Percent adherence was calculated by normalizing the CFU/mL obtained at 30&#8201;min to the initial bacterial inoculum for each strain. Percent invasion and survival/replication were calculated as indicated in the figure legend, either by normalizing to the initial bacterial inoculum or to the total CFU obtained for the previous time point. All statistical comparisons were made in Graphpad using the Student&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05). Two independent biological trials were performed for each experiment, with three technical replicates per trial. Time-matched controls were included for all studies using the non-invasive <italic toggle="yes">E. coli</italic> strain HB101 and untreated samples (latter for imaging studies).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Immunohistochemical profiling</title><p>Fixation, staining and imaging of 3-D aggregates was performed as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Samples were imaged using a Leica TCS SP5 microscope. Images were processed using Leica LAS software. For 3-D perspectives, image stacks acquired by CLSM were median filtered using a (3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3) kernel for noise reduction and then gamma corrected (gamma 0.75) to compensate for image dynamic range. Processed image stacks for each fluorescence channel were then rendered as 3-D perspective surface using an isovolume filter with the open-source image visualization engine ParaView (Henderson A. 2007. ParaView Guide, A Parallel Visualization Application. Kitware, Inc.). Antibodies were purchased from Abcam (CD45, &#946;-catenin, CD84); Life Technologies (ZO-1, MUC5AC); BioLegend (CD68); Kamiya Biomedical (Sialyl Lewis A); and KPL (<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> CSA-1). All antibodies were used at a final dilution of 1:50 in blocking solution (3% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in DPBS) with the exception of anti-&#946;-catenin and anti-Sialyl Lewis A, which were used at a final dilution of 1:100. Goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) was used at a 1:500 dilution in blocking solution for detecting primary antibodies, with the exception of anti-CD68 and anti-<italic toggle="yes">Salmonella</italic> CSA-1, which were FITC-conjugated. For dual labeling purposes with CD45 and MUC5AC, a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody was used that was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>
