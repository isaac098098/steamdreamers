However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> [lunar gravity], and 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25&#8211;35&#160;days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> but only partially recovered by 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. Both 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> and 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> and 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>, but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>. While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing a molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining a healthy state during future spaceflight.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Spaceflight</kwd><kwd>Microgravity</kwd><kwd>Thymus</kwd><kwd>Spleen</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd><kwd>Gene expression</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>Immunology</kwd><kwd>Bone</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004020</institution-id><institution>Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14YPTK-005512</award-id><award-id>19YT000341</award-id><award-id>20YT000259</award-id><award-id>21YT000128</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Satoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Scientific Research on Innovative Area from MEXT</institution></funding-source><award-id>18H04965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Satoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>the Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></funding-source><award-id>JPMJPF2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>Satoru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2024</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Space exploration has attracted attention in various fields, including materials, fuels, communication equipment, systems, medicine, and botany. To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program &#8220;Artemis&#8221; has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. A prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, skeletal muscle function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, vestibular control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, optic nerve papillary edema<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and cardiac hypertrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown.</p><p id="Par3">Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive.</p><p id="Par4">To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> for 35&#160;days using the Multiple Artificial-gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using a centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)-1 mission)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, bone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, eye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, spleen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, thymus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, reproductive system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> on living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long-radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU-4 and -5 missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain a healthy state for future space travel.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions</title><p id="Par6">Figure&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A presents an overview of three MHU missions (MHU-1, -4, and -5).

In the ISS, mice were transferred to the Habitat Cage Unit (HCU), one mouse per cage, and then placed in a centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35&#160;days (MHU-1), 25&#160;days (MHU-4), and 26&#160;days (MHU-5). For the MHU-1 mission, 12 mice were divided into two groups: microgravity (MG) and artificial 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (AG) mice.

MARS-L is approximately 2.2 times larger in diameter than MARS-S, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. The ground control (GC) mice were an experimental group of C57BL/6J male mice of the same age, maintained under the same breeding conditions in the HCU as the space experiment in each mission.

None of the mice returning to Earth from the three missions showed any abnormalities. Following body weight measurements, a mid-air righting reflex test and rotarod test were performed to assess vestibular function and coordinated movements (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B,C). In MHU-1, the latency to right tended to increase non-significantly in MG mice (176&#8201;&#177;&#8201;19&#160;ms) compared to those in artificial 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> (AG) and ground control (1GC) mice (143&#8201;&#177;&#8201;12&#160;ms and 130&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7&#160;ms, respectively) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B). Regardless of the same gravitational environment, the latency to right of partial gravity (4PG) mice (212&#8201;&#177;&#8201;8&#160;ms) in MHU-4 was significantly higher than that of 4GC mice (155&#8201;&#177;&#8201;3&#160;ms), whereas that of 5PG mice (145&#8201;&#177;&#8201;19&#160;ms) in MHU-5 was comparable to that of 5GC mice (150&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4&#160;ms). In the rotarod test, the duration on the rod in AG (48&#8201;&#177;&#8201;4&#160;s) and MG (44&#8201;&#177;&#8201;6&#160;s) mice was significantly shorter than that in 1GC (74&#8201;&#177;&#8201;10&#160;s) mice in the MHU-1 mission (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C). However, the differences between PG and GC in MHU-4 (4PG: 49&#8201;&#177;&#8201;5&#160;s, 4GC: 37&#8201;&#177;&#8201;7&#160;s) and MHU-5 (5PG: 83&#8201;&#177;&#8201;11&#160;s, 5GC: 70&#8201;&#177;&#8201;14&#160;s) were not significant. In the righting reflex test, which evaluates postural control via the vestibular system, mice from the MARS-S and MARS-L in the same 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> group showed different results. 4PG showed the same deterioration as MG, whereas 5PG showed the same results as GC and AG in the 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> group. The two possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows: (1) Difference between the short and long arms: the gravity gradient in the housing chamber of MARS-S, which has short arms, is larger than that of MARS-L, which has long arms. Therefore, each time the height of the head changes, 4PG receives a larger gravitational input into the otolith system. This may have affected vestibular function. (2) Difference in the control performance of the centrifuge used in 4PG and 5PG. The difference is particularly noticeable in a small gravity, such as 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>; the gravity fluctuation was larger in 4PG than that in 5PG, which may have affected vestibular function in 4PG. These two possibilities should be examined in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Lunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity</title><p id="Par8">To investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B).

Although BV/TV decreased in the 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> environment, the degree of decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially prevented in the 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> environment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone formation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in GC mice (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>C).

Though bone loss during spaceflight is mainly caused by osteoblast inhibition, our results showed that the gene expressions of some osteoblasts increased after approximately one month of flight. A recent study using medaka fish showed that osteoblast marker genes are upregulated immediately after exposure to microgravity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Therefore, the gene upregulation in our study might have occurred during the early phase of spaceflight.

Cluster 3 and 4 indicated upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice compared to those in GCs; particularly genes included in cluster 4 were only upregulated in MG mice.

Cluster 5 showed different gene expression profiles between 4 and 5PG mice because centrifuges with different radii might affect the gravity gradient in the cage.

Although difficult to comprehend, data from 4PG mice were dispersed in both these groups. Based on the results of horizontal clustering, the relevant factors of the space experiment, such as radiation or stress, may have largely affected gene expression profiles in the spleen.

Frozen sections of 6-&#956;m thickness were mounted on glass slides coated with amino silane. After fixing with ice-cold acetone for 5&#160;min, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then treated with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD3e (BioLegend; 100236, 1:200), anti-CD45R (B220, BioLegend; 103228, 1:400), anti-TER119 (BioLegend; 116203, 1:300), anti-Keratin 5 (Krt5; Biolegend 905503, 1:500), and Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-Keratin 8 (Krt8; Abcam ab192467, 1:50) antibodies, Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-mouse Aire antibody (eBioscience; 53-5934-82, 1:500), and Biotin-labeled UEA-1 (Vector laboratories; B-1065-2, 1:50) in PBS containing 10% goat serum for 1&#160;h at 24&#160;&#176;C, after washing, and further incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen; A-11035, 1:500) Alexa Flour 546-labeled Streptavidin (Invitrogen; <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="pmc:entrez-protein" xlink:href="S11225">S11225</ext-link>, 1:500) for 1&#160;h at 24&#160;&#176;C, the sections were covered with glass coverslips using a mounting solution.
