This device referred to as the NemaLife chip features: (1) an optimized micropillar arena in which animals can crawl, (2) sieve channels that separate progeny and prevent the loss of adults from the arena during culture maintenance, and (3) ports that allow rapid accessibility for feeding the adult-only population and introducing reagents as needed. The pillar arena geometry was optimized to accommodate the growing body size during culture and emulate the body gait and locomotion of animals reared on agar. Likewise, feeding protocols were optimized to recapitulate longevity outcomes typical of standard plate growth. Key benefits of the NemaLife Chip include eliminating the need to perform repeated manual transfers of adults during survival assays, negating the need for progeny-blocking chemical interventions, and avoiding the swim-induced stress across lifespan in animals reared in liquid. We also show that the culture of animals in pillar-less microfluidic chambers reduces lifespan and introduces physiological stress by increasing the occurrence of age-related vulval integrity disorder. We validated our pillar-based device with longevity analyses of classical aging mutants (<italic toggle="yes">daf-2</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">age-1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">eat-2,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">daf-16</italic>) and animals subjected to RNAi knockdown of age-related genes (<italic toggle="yes">age-1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">daf-16</italic>). We also showed that healthspan measures such as pharyngeal pumping and tap-induced stimulated reversals can be scored across the lifespan in the NemaLife chip. Overall, the capacity to generate reliable lifespan and physiological data underscores the potential of the NemaLife chip to accelerate healthspan and lifespan investigations in <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Caenorhabditis elegans</kwd><kwd>Lab-on-a-chip</kwd><kwd>Ageing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Aging is a significant risk factor for a broad range of diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes and cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. With the growing aging population, the socioeconomic burden attributed with age-associated diseases is staggering and development of therapies that promote healthy aging is imperative. <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> is a powerful model organism for aging investigations with a short lifespan (3&#8211;5&#160;weeks), genetic similarity with humans (~&#8201;38% orthologs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>) and conserved signaling pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Additionally, a fully mapped genome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and genetic plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> makes C. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> an attractive tool for aging studies. Advances in fluorescent microscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and genomic technology (RNAi, CRISPR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have further expanded the number of possible ways in which C. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> can be used to study healthy aging.
</p><p id="Par3">Lifespan analysis has become a widely used method for evaluating the effects of various genes, proteins, and drug compounds on aging and age-associated diseases. In general, lifespan assays are carried out with <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> reared on agar plates containing nematode growth media (NGM). During the reproductive phase, adults must be manually transferred to new plates to separate progeny from the original sample. These animal transfers significantly increase the effort and time required for conducting lifespan assays. To reduce the work costs of manual transfers, many labs utilize a strong progeny-blocking drug (2&#8242;-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, FUdR) to maintain an adult-only population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. An alternative to this approach is the use of sterile mutants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The simplicity of using FUdR or sterile mutants has led to new technologies for large-scale lifespan analysis in <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic>. A technology known as Lifespan Machine (LSM), allows for the rapid analysis of a population of thousands of animals grown on agar supplemented with FUdR using automatic capture of sequential images to score animal death and determine lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The LSM technology has provided insights into temporal scaling of ageing dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and helped identify chemical compounds with robust longevity effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Similarly, WorMotel technology facilitates longitudinal analysis of individuals in agar-filled microfabricated well plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In a recent addition, WormBot technology employed robotic platform to image and measure lifespan of animals cultured on agar surface in a 24-well plate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Although powerful, LSM, WorMotel, and WormBot technologies have some limitations. The useof FUdR is undesirable as FuDR has been shown to activate stress response pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, alter body size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, increase superoxide dismutase levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, increase fat accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and alter the survival of worms with specific genetic backgrounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Moreover, the timing of FUdR treatment is critical, such that premature supplementation of FUdR results in abnormalities such as a high percentage of vulval protrusion, also known as age-related vulval integrity disorder (AVID)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Another issue with the LSM and WorMotel technologies is the difficulty in studying the effect of temporal changes in environment on lifespan since these require transferring of animals to new plates. Such temporal manipulations have been central to studies of dietary restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and functional cognitive aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. In addition, uptake of drugs by animals maintained on plates is an ongoing challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In recent years, microfluidic approaches have begun to address the limitations of agar-based lifespan assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Several key advantages of using PDMS-based microfluidics include (1) excellent permeability to oxygen and carbon dioxide, enabling animals to experience natural atmospheric conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>; (2) size-based separation of animals using on-chip filters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, eliminating the need to prevent or reduce progeny production; (3) precise temporal control of culture environment via addition or removal of reagents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>; (4) overall reduction in the number of censored worms; and (5) optical transparency of devices to enable bright field and fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="Par7">Significant advantages of microfluidics has led to the development of lifespan-devices for measuring survival curves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, a major drawback of prior devices is that <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> swims in the engineered chambers, similar to liquid cultures in multiwell plates. Physiologically, swimming in liquid culture is more energetically demanding than crawling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In liquid environments, <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> can exhibit swimming and quiescent states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, making lifespan outcomes in liquid culture difficult to interpret. Also, housing worms in liquid culture for a significant portion of their lifespan has been shown to induce gene expression changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Taken together, these findings suggest that conducting whole-life studies in microfluidic chambers where animals swim may not be representative of the physiology that crawling animals experience on plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, measures such as pharyngeal pumping which can be predictive of healthspan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> are difficult to score in swimming animals.</p><p id="Par8">Given the importance of mimicking plate-like behaviors in microfluidic devices, several studies have incorporated micropillars in microfluidic chambers and showed that the pillar arrangement can be configured to achieve locomotory gait similar to that on agar plates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Additional studies have used these microstructured devices to study chemotactic behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, separate different larval-stage animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> and perform stress assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Thus, micropillar devices are well suited to induce plate-like crawling behaviors; however, to date, whole-life culturing of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> in micropillar environments has not been demonstrated and their suitability for measuring survival curves remains to be ascertained.</p><p id="Par9">Here we report an optimized microfluidic device, termed NemaLife Chip, for whole-life studies in <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> that addresses the limitations of agar-based approaches and microfluidic swim-chambers. The device has sieve channels to retain adults but enable progeny removal by fluid flow. Since previous micropillar devices have not been configured for life-long culture and survival outcomes, we optimize food concentrations and feeding frequency. Importantly, we show that whole-life culturing of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> in chambers without pillars induces deleterious health effects. Furthermore, we show that the use of a micropillar housing arena increases the efficiency of scoring various health span metrics, including pharyngeal pumping and locomotory phenotypes. Validation of NemaLife chip through the analysis of established aging mutants, RNAi studies, and various culture conditions demonstrates that this new microfluidic device provides a simple platform with the potential to advance our fundamental understanding of genetic and environmental regulators of healthy aging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Optimization of the NemaLife chip design</title><p id="Par10"><italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> lifespan measurement in a microfluidic environment requires mimicking plate-like behaviors with the capacity to remove progeny.

The measured dimensions of the three pillar devices are reported in Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>. During the greatest period of growth, C. <italic toggle="yes">elegans</italic> body diameter varies from&#8201;~&#8201;50 to 100&#160;&#181;m and length varies from&#8201;~&#8201;900 to 1500&#160;&#181;m (Fig. <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Thus, Device I provided the tightest, and Device III the leanest, confinement for the animals during the lifespan measurement.</p><p id="Par15">In all the devices, the pillars had a uniform height of &#8776;&#8201;75&#160;&#956;m and a clearance from the floor of the habitat chamber of approximately &#8776;&#8201;25&#160;&#956;m, allowing the pillars to be moved aside by the animal to adjust gait and accommodate changes in body size. The gap between the pillars and the clearance between the pillar tip and the floor also helps in size-based separation of the adults from the larvae and eggs. An adult&#8217;s body diameter is much larger than the clearance and the animal interacts with approximately 10&#8211;16 pillars along its body, which prevents the animal from being washed away during fluid flow. Specifically, animals maintain their posture and crawl normally using the pillar support while the progeny, eggs and other smaller particles are removed via fluid flow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sieve channel design</title><p id="Par16">Our optimized sieve channels have a width of 25&#8211;30&#160;&#956;m, length of 750&#160;&#956;m, and are separated from each other by 75&#160;&#956;m&#8201;&#215;&#8201;750&#160;&#956;m rectangular blocks. We designed the length of the rectangular blocks long enough so that the animal cannot generate natural waves and propagate through the channels.

On agar, we found 5&#8211;30% animal loss over the course of the assay. It is common to lose animals on agar plates due to (1) crawling up along the side wall and death from desiccation, (2) burrowing into the soft agar which precludes scoring, and (3) bagging. Animal loss due to desiccation and burrowing depends on the type of strain, sex, mutation, and intervention used, and sometimes may account for as much as 50% of the total animal population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. As death events due to desiccation and burrowing cannot be scored, whether agar-based lifespan is a measure of a selected subset of a population becomes a question. Moreover, loss of animals increases the number of worms needed to initiate each experiment as loss must be anticipated.</p><p id="Par39">We found that the NemaLife chip eliminates the incidences of animal loss from desiccation and burrowing due to culture in an enclosed microfluidic chamber. We observed a 0&#8211;6% animal loss, which could be attributed to washing mistakes (human error of not plugging the loading port, which lacks a sieve channel, or of excess pressure application for fluid flow such that animals close to the sieve channel squeeze out). Animal loss/censoring from bagging was 1&#8211;6% in the NemaLife chip compared to about 2&#8211;10% on agar plates in this study.</p><p id="Par40">We also evaluated whether the NemaLife chip induces environmental stresses such as starvation in the animals.

As a result, temporal fluctuations in locomotion make it difficult to evaluate true crawling speed. Extended tracking and long-term analysis of time-lapse images are required to properly assess forward locomotion dynamics. Reversals are observed during natural locomotion and are important for escape in response to gentle touch, a behavior in which the worm quickly reverses and suppresses head movement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>.

In the NemaLife chip, progeny washing is done by a hand-syringe (connected with a tubing and a pin) allowing the user to wash one chamber and move to the next. The scoring in NemaLife chip also takes less time since the population of 100 animals is compartmentalized into 9 smaller chambers with fewer animals compared to plates. On NGM plates, animals explore a larger footprint and with a limited field of view which requires searching.

Despite these inadvertent errors, we were still able to obtain experimental data since the chip has 9 chambers and censoring of one or two chambers provides meaningful data although at a reduced sample size. We did not observe any major failure of NemaLife chambers due to clogging. The NemaLife chambers are designed symmetrically with respect to inlet and outlet. Our protocol involved using each port alternatively and thus keeping the sieve channels free of clogging. In addition, contamination of chips was not observed due to pre-sterilization of chambers prior to experimentation and also because the enclosed chamber minimizes exposure of the small amount of culture fluid (&#8776;&#8201;6.75&#160;&#956;L) to ambient environment. Finally, we note that the NemaLife chips cannot be reused for lifespan as the chambers accumulate chemicals and bacterial residue over the lifespan assay potentially influencing aging biology and lifespan of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> if chips are re-used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">We demonstrated that <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> can be effectively maintained in our NemaLife microfluidic device across its lifespan without using chemicals (progeny-blocking drugs, antibacterial agents, antifungal compounds, etc.) in an environment that recapitulates longevity on agar plates. The closed microfluidic environment keeps animals inside the arena boundary and eliminates the events of death by desiccation. Being fully occupied with fluid, the culture environment maintains uniform humidity and minimizes temperature fluctuations. Micropillars in the microfluidic device enable the animals to maintain natural crawling gaits and eliminate swim-induced stress. The well characterized survival outcomes of &#8220;cornerstone&#8221; longevity mutants with altered insulin-like signaling or dietary restriction pathways grown on agar are reproduced in the device; RNAi can also be executed.</p><p id="Par62">The capacity for manual injections of fluids and food enables investigator control over feeding conditions or introduced drugs. For compound testing, the liquid environment in the NemaLife chip ensures the uniform availability of the compound which is difficult to ensure in agar-filled plates. In the NemaLife chip, we replace the old environment (larva, eggs, 24&#160;h old bacteria and buffer, pheromones, excrete etc.) daily with fresh food. As a result, animals can be exposed to a fresh dose of compounds daily, similar to dosing schedules with mammalian models. An added benefit of the device is that progeny and effluent (containing any chemicals such as, pheromones etc.) might be collected for downstream analysis.</p><p id="Par63">The NemaLife chip was also designed to improve the scoring of live/dead animals. The microfluidic chip consists of 9 smaller chambers on a 2"&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3" glass slide. Small footprint of an individual chamber is entirely visible at 10&#8201;&#215;&#8201;or 20&#8201;&#215; magnification on a stereomicroscope. Each chamber was optimized to house 10&#8211;15 animals so that one can score animal surival easily. Thus, we achieve a large enough sample size for drawing meaningful statistical inferences without employing a computer vision system and complicated imaging system otherwise required for a larger chamber. These considerations make the NemaLife chip easily implementable in research labs conducting lifespan assays and investigator scoring options provide quality control on data.</p><p id="Par64">In sum, the NemaLife chip is a simple and low-cost means to obtain reliable lifespan and physiological data on aging animals. The NemaLife chip can be developed into a fully automated platform, that can offer progeny removal, feeding, drug delivery, and phenotypic scoring using automated pump systems and an appropriate software. Thus, the NemaLife chip has a significant potential both as a low-cost &#8220;manual&#8221; device that can be used in many labs and as a core component of a fully automated platform.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Worm culture</title><p id="Par65">All animals were cultured on 60&#160;mm petri dishes containing nematode growth medium (NGM) at 20&#160;&#176;C before loading into the microfluidic chamber.
