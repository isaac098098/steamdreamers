Spaceflight is associated with many (mal)adaptations in physiology, including decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems. Biological experiments in space are inherently challenging to implement. Development of hardware and validation of experimental conditions are critical to ensure the collection of high-quality data. The model organism <bold><italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic></bold> has been studied in space for more than 20 years to better understand spaceflight-induced (patho)physiology, particularly spaceflight-induced muscle decline. These experiments have used a variety of hardware configurations. Despite this, hardware used in the past was not available for our most recent experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME). Therefore, we had to design and validate flight hardware for MME. MME provides a contemporary example of many of the challenges faced by researchers conducting <bold><italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic></bold> experiments onboard the International Space Station. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation, in addition to the ground-based experiment scientific validation testing. These experiences and operational solutions allow others to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions. </p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Spaceflight</kwd><kwd>Space biology</kwd><kwd>Astrobiology</kwd><kwd><italic toggle="yes">C. elegans&#8212;</italic></kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="28"/><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s001"><title>1.&#8194;Introduction</title><p>Space is an extreme environment in which humans have been routinely living and working for more than 20 years, and ambitions remain to live and work further beyond Earth. Spaceflight is associated with deconditioning of multiple bodily systems, including the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, vestibular, and immune systems (Demontis <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Strollo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Physiological decline occurs despite participation in exercise countermeasures, which are a potent stimulus to promote musculoskeletal and cardiovascular adaptation (Trappe <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and optimal immune function (Simpson <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) on Earth. While vestibular adaptations take place in the first days after transition to the microgravity environment, decline in musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and immune systems can worsen with missions of greater duration (Fitts <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Strollo <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>), potentially limiting our capacity for interplanetary missions such as to Mars (Gaffney <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>).</p><p>These challenges have motivated research around strategies to prevent this (mal)adaptation in space. As the precise molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced physiological deconditioning have not been identified, this limits our ability to design molecularly rationalized countermeasures.</p><p>Biological experiments in space can, however, be methodologically challenging. Although the United States has designated the US segment of the International Space Station (ISS) as a National Laboratory, experiments are not routinely carried out by using standardized equipment or methods that are in common use in other laboratories on Earth. Size, power, mass, late access for experiment integration onto the rocket, and ability to oversee the experiment remain challenges, despite more than 40 years of conducting biology experiments in space. Thus, the development of hardware and the validation of experimental conditions remain critical in the acquisition of quality data that can ultimately promote understanding of biological changes in space that should underpin rationale countermeasures to physiological changes in space.</p><p>Our current experiment, the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), uses the model organism, <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, to explore the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy. <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> is an established model organism for studies on Earth (Kaletta and Hengartner, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Corsi <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Shen <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) and in space (Szewczyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Higashitani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Honda <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, 2014; Higashibata <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>In the context of very limited access to space, the short life span and microscopic size of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> enable data to be collected across the entire life span (Gaffney <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>) in high <italic toggle="yes">n</italic> numbers and replicates to generate robust data rapidly. The operational requirements of MME include many that apply to biological payloads across species (<italic toggle="yes">e.g.</italic>, late access, temperature-controlled upload/download, and time critical astronaut interventions). MME is therefore a generalizable example of many of the challenges in conducting contemporary astrobiology research onboard the ISS.</p><p><italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> have been studied in space for more than 20 years by using a variety of spaceflight hardware configurations (Ishioka and Higashibata, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). With the exception of STS-107 (Szewczyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), all past flights involved in the study of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> have used nonstandard laboratory hardware. It is therefore not surprising that <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> spaceflight experiments can fail due to lack of sufficient oxygen to support the worms (Warren <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), a problem that can be dealt with through preflight ground testing. Here, we describe the hardware selection and validation in addition to the ground-based experiment sequence validation testing for MME.</p><p>The first key challenge was overcoming the difficulty of growing worms inside plastic bags. The second key challenge was working out timings to allow upload to the ISS using passive temperature control. These studies should allow other researchers to replicate and/or improve our experimental design on future missions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>2.&#8194;Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>2.1.&#8194;Nematode and bacteria preparation</title><p>The <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> strain PD55 (<italic toggle="yes">ccIs55</italic> (<italic toggle="yes">unc-54::lacZ</italic>) V) was used for development and testing phases of this study. Animals were cultured at 20&#176;C by using standard methods on nematode growth media plates. To obtain L1 animals, age synchronizations were carried out by gravity settling as described previously (Gaffney <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). During the hardware development phases, <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 was grown overnight in LB-broth, centrifuged, and resuspended in S-Basal; 500 or 5000 L1 were used in experiments with 3&#8211;10&#8201;mL of OP50.</p><p>During the hardware development phases and all experimentation unless stipulated otherwise, stocks were prepared by adding 5000 L1 larvae to 6&#8201;mL of freeze-dried OP50 (LabTie; StartLife, Netherlands) in S-Basal.

Animals were cultured for a minimum of 2 weeks following transfer from plates before synchronization.</p><p>During final preflight testing of the launch procedures, age synchronizations were carried out from liquid culture stocks rather than from plates to obtain 5000 L1 larvae the day before loading into bags. These cultures were left overnight in 6-well tissue culture dishes in a final volume of 500&#8201;&#956;L freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal at 20&#176;C. The next day, 6&#8201;mL freeze-dried OP50 was pipetted into each well before loading into flight culture bags.</p></sec><sec id="s004"><title>2.2.&#8194;Validation of culture bags</title><p>The experimental design for launch involved growing worms inside gas-permeable plastic bags onboard the ISS. Therefore, we tested the biocompatibility of three different bag materials: (i) polyethylene (PE) bags (1.5 inch, 250 gauge, Lay Flat Polythene Tubing; Kite Packaging Ltd., United Kingdom), (ii) Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) PE bags (Nipro, Japan), and (iii) fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) bags (Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics; TOSS GmbH, Germany). The PE bags and FEP bags are low friction and allow good gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, although gas exchange is reported to be superior in FEP to PE in bags of equal thickness (NB. all bags have previously supported <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> cultures in spaceflight experiments onboard the ISS).</p><p>The JAXA bags are a proprietary PE blend that is no longer commercially available. To test the bags, 5000 L1 larvae were placed in the bag with OP50 before bags were heat sealed (Pacseal<sup>+</sup> impulse heat sealer; Rajapack, United Kingdom), and then, the worms were cultured for 7 days at 20&#176;C. After 7 days, the total worm population in each bag was counted. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out in GraphPad Prism to compare the populations of worms in the three bags.</p></sec><sec id="s005"><title>2.3.&#8194;Oxygen consumption rates</title><p>To investigate whether diet influenced changes in oxygen consumption rates (OCR), measurements were carried out with the Seahorse XFe24 Analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), as previously described (Hewitt <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Koopman <italic toggle="yes">et al.,</italic>
<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).

Adult animals were washed twice in incubation media [M9 buffer: 22.04&#8201;mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 42.27&#8201;mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 85.56&#8201;mM NaCl (final concentrations, sterilized)] and placed in 200&#8201;&#956;L M9-filled wells of standard Seahorse plates (20 worms/well) in 5 replicates per condition. Stable OCR measurements were taken by performing five measurement cycles for basal OCR, nine cycles for maximal OCR following the addition of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) (10&#8201;&#956;M final well concentration), and five cycles for nonmitochondrial OCR following the addition of sodium azide (40&#8201;nM final well concentration).</p><p>OCR measurements were normalized to the number of worms per well. To obtain stable OCR measurements, the final three, seven, and two measurement cycles were used for the statistical analysis of basal, maximal, and nonmitochondrial OCR, respectively, as previously described (Hewitt <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Differences in OCR were detected with a one-way ANOVA with Tukey's multiple comparison test using GraphPad Prism 8 (La Jolla, CA). Statistical significance was set at <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s006"><title>2.4.&#8194;Culture volume optimization</title><p>Age-synchronized L1 larvae were placed into experimental bags containing freeze-dried OP50 in S-Basal (5000 L1 worms per bag). The amount of OP50 in the bag was optimized where 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10&#8201;mL volumes were tested. Three biological replicates were carried out per condition.</p></sec><sec id="s007"><title>2.5.&#8194;Hardware development and validation</title><p>For flight, the experimental bags were to be placed into European Space Agency (ESA) experiment cassettes (ECs). As <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> require oxygen to develop, gas exchange between the inside of the EC and outside of the EC is required. ECs that allowed gas exchange via a gas-permeable Gortex membrane have previously been used with <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> onboard the ISS (Szewczyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>); unfortunately, these were no longer available for use with MME. Therefore, we had to design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>) and validate new ECs (Kayser Italia, Livorno, Italy).</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIG. 1.</label><caption><p>Hardware for the MME.

Once complete, the population of viable worms in the bags were counted under a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ645; Nikon, Japan) and compared against control bags that were otherwise identical except were located outside the EC.</p><p>Two different cage inserts for the ECs were designed and tested to maintain separation between the bags during the turbulent upload phase of launch, to maintain a surface area for gas exchange in flight, and to prevent the bags from freezing together at the end of the experiment. To test which cage design was best, worms were grown in bags alone, in cage design 1, and in cage design 2.

This suggests that OP50-grown worms could have been limited for oxygen inside the FEP bags, whereas the CeMM grown worms were not.

As shown in <xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, both short and long cold stowage followed by 6 days of incubation produced viable cultures. These results suggested that even the longest duration cold stowage followed by a period of incubation onboard the ISS would be a suitable operational solution for MME.</p><p>As passive rather than active temperature control was preferred for upload operations, we tested the effect of passive cold stowage using NASA's phase change materials. Given that 12&#176;C active temperature control during upload produced viable cultures, we first tested NASA's 12&#176;C phase change materials temperature profile during long upload. As shown in <xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, long cold stowage when using NASA's 12&#176;C phase change materials temperature profile did not produce viable cultures, with worms running out of food about 1 day before the end of the incubation at 20&#176;C.</p><p>This result may appear surprising; however, the phase change material starts at 10&#176;C and ramps up to 14&#176;C over the period of cold stowage. Thus, from an engineering perspective, the 12&#176;C phase change materials do indeed maintain 12&#176;C&#8201;&#177;&#8201;2&#176;C, but from a biological perspective, this is quite different from the 12&#176;C&#8201;&#177;&#8201;0.5&#176;C achieved via active temperature control. Confirming that 10&#176;C phase change materials also maintain within +/&#8722;2&#176;C, we tested long cold stowage using NASA's 10&#176;C phase change materials temperature profile, which did produce viable cultures (<xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Having confirmed a viable passive stowage upload scenario for MME, we finally tested the impact of a short upload scenario with the 10&#176;C phase change materials (1 day turnover to launch, 3 days to station, 1 day to put in incubator) and found that this also produced viable cultures (<xref rid="tb2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Thus, through various iterations of testing that included what we might do to culture worms in our own laboratory, to implementing operational restrictions imposed by launch and upload to the ISS coupled with a better understanding of passive cold stowage performance, we were able to achieve a viable experimental protocol.

Unsurprisingly, we found that it did, which enabled us to optimize culture volume for MME, something not done for ICE-FIRST (Szewczyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>We also examined worm oxygen consumption using the diet from ICE-FIRST, CeMM (Szewczyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and the diet from CERISE, OP50 (Higashitani <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Consistent with the biological changes for worms grown in CeMM (Szewczyk <italic toggle="yes">et al.</italic>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), we found that the worms consumed less oxygen. Collectively, our results suggest that growing worms in plastic culture bags does pose a challenge to worm experiment viability. The use of CeMM rather than OP50 as a food source may therefore reduce the oxygen exchange requirement and thus increase the viability of worm experiments conducted inside plastic culture bags on the ISS, but this comes with the added challenge that CeMM is more prone to become contaminated.</p><p>Regardless, it remains clear that proper ground testing is required preflight despite past successful <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> spaceflight experiments. Additionally, in contrast to challenges with experimental bags and gas exchange, the development of new ECs, similarly dependent on effective surface area to volume ratios, presented no problems. Gas exchange in the ECs was capable of producing a viable experiment. This result suggests that for future experiments it is likely that gas exchange between the <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> culture and ISS will be limited principally by the exchange properties of the culture bags and not the ECs.</p><p>The second most challenging portion of our preflight testing was testing and finalizing suitable scenarios for upload to the ISS that were consistent both with current operational realities and with successfully conducting our experiment. The data on durations from payload handover until integration on the ISS provided us with a realistic range of upload timings and should prove useful for others planning to upload via Dragon with NASA cold stowage.</p><p>Using these timings, we were able to establish that a <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> payload can be kept in a stasis during cold upload at 8&#8211;12&#176;C, then subsequently grow and reproduce effectively. Of note, while the use of phase change material removed the need for active temperature control during upload, it was critical that we tested the performance of the phase change material temperature profile. Indeed, for biologically active cultures, phase change material provides a significantly different temperature profile than active temperature control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s017"><title>5.&#8194;Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have updated the flight hardware and upload conditions available to support <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> experiments onboard the ISS. These validations provide a platform for MME and future investigators to successfully, and efficiently, conduct experiments onboard the ISS.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the UK Space Agency, ESA, JAXA, and BIOTESC for their support of the Molecular Muscle Experiment.</p></ack><sec id="s018" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Author Disclosure Statement</title><p>No competing financial interests exist.</p></sec><sec id="s019"><title>Funding Information</title><p>This work was supported by the BBSRC (Grant Nos.
