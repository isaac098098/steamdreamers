One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the &#8220;space production&#8221; of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (<italic toggle="yes">Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions&#8212;0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6&#8211;12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5&#8211;8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic toggle="yes">Triticum aestivum</italic> L.</kwd><kwd>wheat kernel</kwd><kwd>starch granules</kwd><kwd>growing in space conditions</kwd><kwd>space station</kwd><kwd>hyperspectral imaging</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source>Russian State Assignment</funding-source><award-id>122042700002-6</award-id><award-id>FGUM-2022-0003</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation</funding-source><award-id>075-15-2020-905</award-id><award-id>2744-r</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Scientific Center &#8220;Agrotechnologies of the Future&#8221;</funding-source><award-id>RSAU-MTAA</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source>Theme Russian State Assignment</funding-source><award-id>65.4</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was partially supported by Russian State Assignment &#8470; 122042700002-6 (MBG, T.S.A., E.N.B.) and FGUM-2022-0003 (ARRIAB RAS, E.N.B., A.A.G.), Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation in accordance with agreement No. 075-15-2020-905 on providing a grant No. 2744-r (the Scientific Center &#8220;Agrotechnologies of the Future&#8221;, which funded this research under grant RSAU-MTAA, E.N.B. and K.A.S.) and Theme Russian State Assignment 65.4 (IBP, M.A.L.).

Introduction</title><p>When planning piloting beyond our planet and long-term space exploration, the possibility of obtaining food in a new place is taken into account, because delivery to Mars, the Moon, or a space station will be unreasonably high in cost, long, and irregular [<xref rid="B1-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Therefore, ongoing work is underway to improve greenhouses with a controlled environment to ensure sustainable food security, as well as research into plants suitable for such conditions, primarily dwarf plants, and those with accelerated development [<xref rid="B2-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Plants are selected that are resistant to high levels of ethylene, with a short period of obtaining marketable products, compact size, high productivity, and self-reproduction (from seed to seed) [<xref rid="B3-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Plants in space can serve not only as a source of food, but also for the in situ production of pharmaceuticals, air regeneration, water recycling, and improving the mental health of astronauts [<xref rid="B4-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In near space conditions, technologies have already been developed for producing plants from seed to seed using model plants, for example, <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> [<xref rid="B7-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> [<xref rid="B8-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as cultivated annual plants of various families.</p><p>The main crops consumed by humans are wheat, rice, corn, and sorghum [<xref rid="B9-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Previously, attempts to grow cereals were sporadic and often ended in failure [<xref rid="B2-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B10-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Currently, methods for cultivating wheat [<xref rid="B11-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have been developed (sorghum, due to the absence of dwarf forms, remains not yet relevant). The breakthrough in the cultivation of these crops is associated with overcoming pollination problems associated with certain development issues and gas requirements, particularly ethylene [<xref rid="B13-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the range of dwarf forms of rice and wheat makes it possible to achieve sustainable results, both on the ISS [<xref rid="B10-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and on the name of the Tiangong Chinese station [<xref rid="B14-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Kernel parameters such as length, width, weight, and shape make the most significant contribution in yield assessment [<xref rid="B15-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The composition and ratio of different types of starch grains in the endosperm, as well as the protein content, mainly related to the quantity and characteristics of the formation of the aleurone layer, determine the quality criteria of the resulting flour and other processed products [<xref rid="B2-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Quality assessment based on completion and the symmetry of kernels makes flour production predictable.</p><p>Despite the fact that the very issue of obtaining a crop of cereals grown under near space conditions has now already been resolved, even with the use of genetic analysis [<xref rid="B16-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the issue of assessing crop quality, and, in particular, the symmetry of the grains still remains unstudied.</p><p>The quality of the harvest is already checked on Earth. To identify clear patterns and long-term consequences, it is necessary to create express methods for diagnosing seed quality already in orbit. This must be accompanied by the development of non-destructive assessment methods to maintain the feasibility of using seeds in experiments. One such method could be phenotypic assessment and assessment of shape and color based on various pre-assessed indices. There have not yet been any studies on the asymmetry of plant organs grown in space, and we could not find the results of using hyperspectral analysis for these purposes.</p><p>Due to the characteristics of cultivation and the possible action of various factors, wheat, grown in a growth chamber with conditionally full compliance with temperature, lighting, and humidity on the ISS, will be subject to a number of stressful influences to which they are poorly adapted: 24 h light; a constant, relatively warm temperature; and poor light quality. The major difference between the two environments is gravity. Because the wheat plants have phototropism, the effects on gravitropism on plant development were studied. Kernels of smaller weight, length, width, area, and perimeter will be formed in a such condition. This assumption was designated as hypothesis A.</p><p>It was also hypothesized that the level of wheat kernel asymmetry would be higher on the ISS board (hypothesis B). A visual method for assessing the asymmetry of the kernel on a cross section of a kernel was previously proposed [<xref rid="B18-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, since the amount of grain collected on the ISS was limited, it was also necessary to develop a method for asymmetry evaluation without cutting into these unique accessions. A hypothesis was also assumed (hypothesis C) that there is a relationship between the asymmetry of the kernel and its main parameters, and the stronger the asymmetry, the lower the weight, since asymmetry is probably characteristic of puny (unfulfilled, immature) kernels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-13-00073"><title>2. Results</title><p>The wheat plants obtained during the full-size experiment on the ISS and in the ground laboratory Lada greenhouse were harvested after reaching the full maturity stage. The kernels were husked from the ears, weighed, and stored under the same conditions. To determine the natural range of differences, visually determined parameters were assessed. At the same time, it was found that some of the kernels were larger in size and had a fully formed shape; some had signs of stunting, namely an uneven and asymmetrical shape. This scatter is typical for kernels formed on spikelets in different zones of the ear, wherein well-filled kernels were formed in the spikelets of the central part of the ear, and puny kernels were formed in the upper and lower parts.</p><p>Another morphological phenomenon that needed to be taken into account was the presence of a through hole in some of the kernels, probably associated with unknown variability and peculiarities of the formation of the middle part of the endosperm. This feature can be noted for part of the grains as a characteristic feature both for kernels of Super Dwarf wheat grown in the field, and for kernels of wheat grown in Lada greenhouses under the conditions of a ground experiment and in low-Earth orbit under the conditions of the ISS. This hole was observed in both well-filled and puny kernels, that is, these signs were not related. The identified natural fluctuations of the signs of &#8220;puny/well-fulfilled&#8221; and the &#8220;presence/absence of a through hole&#8221; were taken into account when analyzing kernels and forming a sample for analysis.</p><sec id="sec2dot1-plants-13-00073"><title>2.1. Descriptive Statistics of Kernels</title><p>It was found that wheat grown on the ISS has significantly smaller kernels by weight (by 0.0014 g), area (by 1.68 mm<sup>2</sup>), length (by 0.45 mm), and width (by 0.11 mm). However, the differences between the perimeter, depth, and roundness of the kernels are not statistically significant (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which partially confirms hypothesis A.</p><p>Based on kernel weights, large ones predominate in both samples (0.0364&#8211;0.0415 g), in the sample with the ISS there are 46 kernels out of 100 and in the control 43 out of 85 accessions. There are 33 medium-sized (0.0312&#8211;0.0363 g) kernels with ISS and 13 control ones (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-f001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

In the control variant, kernels of medium, small, and large (14.0&#8211;15.6 mm<sup>2</sup>) sizes predominate&#8212;38, 19, and 18 pieces out of 85, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-plants-13-00073"><title>2.2. Checking for Kernel Asymmetry Using Non-Traumatic Methods</title><p>A study of the first non-traumatic method for determining the asymmetry of kernel using the methods of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry at points of 50, 25, and 75% of the kernel length on a sample of 15 kernels did not establish significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. Increasing the sample to 30 kernels led to an increase in the significance of the Mann&#8211;Whitney and Kruskal&#8211;Wallis coefficients, indicating that there were no significant differences between the left and right sides of the kernel. That is, this method is not able to detect asymmetry even in those grains in which it is visually present.</p><p>The second method of comparing the length of the left and right sides of the kernel for all samples of the Super Dwarf cultivar using the <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test method showed that there are no differences only between the distances from the tops of the folds of the left and right sides of the endosperm to the axis of symmetry. When examining the samples separately, it was found that the left and right sides differ along all perpendiculars in kernels with ISS, while in the control variant there are no differences only between the distances from the tops of the folds of the left and right sides of the endosperm to the axis of symmetry.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-13-00073"><title>2.3.

The lateral lobes form morphologically slightly before the central lobe. Thus, kernel defects and environmental stress often affect the central lobe (the angle between lines 10 and 11) more than the lateral lobes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-plants-13-00073"><title>2.4. Relationship between the Main Kernel Parameters and Asymmetry Indicators Obtained in a Non-Traumatic Manner</title><p>In terms of the direction of asymmetry, in 42 kernels from ISS, a pronounced shift of indices to the left was observed. This may indicate that these kernels were located on the right in the ear. Also, in nine kernels, there was a clear shift to the right, thirty-two kernels were symmetrical, and, in seventeen kernels, this indicator could not be reliably determined (for example, two indices were shifted to the left, two indices were shifted to the right, and one was symmetrical). The control variant had 38 kernels with indices shifted to the left, 9&#8212;to the right, 27 have pronounced symmetry, and in 11 kernels the indicator could not be unambiguously determined.</p><p>According to the fluctuating asymmetry (FA) scale developed by Aniskina et al. (2023) [<xref rid="B18-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], kernels from the ISS and control ones have a low and very low level of asymmetry (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-f004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). For example, 48 kernels with a low level of asymmetry and 42 ones with a very low level were received from the ISS, while in the control ground variant there were 31 and 42 of these, respectively. The average level of FA (index 0.132&#8211;0.192) was in seven kernels from the ISS and in nine from the control ground variant, a high level of FA was in two kernels from the ISS and in three kernels from the ground experiment, and a very high (0.254&#8211;0.314) FA level was observed only in one kernel from the ISS. The <italic toggle="yes">t</italic>-test did not establish significant differences in fluctuating asymmetry between kernels from ISS and the control variant; that is, hypothesis B was not confirmed.</p><p>Correlation analysis of traits showed that there was a significant strong relationship between FA and relative asymmetry index 4 in both the control and cosmic kernels. The direction of asymmetry was strongly associated with index 3 in both treatments, and with index 5 in kernels from ISS. That is, to minimize labor costs and speed up calculations, it is enough to take measurements from the edges to the axis through the radicle (L4 and L4&#8217;) and from the edges to the axis through the hole (L3 and L3&#8217;); in addition, you can measure the distance from the edge to the axis at an angle of 45% (L5 and L5&#8217;).</p><p>The relationship between the weight of the kernels, area, perimeter, roundness, length, and width with asymmetry indicators has not been established. That is, hypothesis C turned out to be incorrect.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-plants-13-00073"><title>2.5. Comparison of Starch Granules in Kernels from the ISS and from Ground Experiment</title><p>It is customary to divide starch granules into type A (size &lt; 10 &#181;m) and type B (&gt;10 &#181;m). A comparison of the coefficients of variation for a scattering of starch granules of type A in kernels from the ISS and from Earth (ground experiment) showed that the greatest variability in length and width was present in matured (filled) kernels (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Granules of type B are more aligned, for example, the variability in the width of puny kernels was 46% for granules of type A, and half as much for granules of type B (21%). The indices of the length and width of type A granules for kernels from the ISS and from Earth are the same&#8212;11 and 14% for mature kernels, and 12 and 11% for puny ones.</p><p>The length of type A starch granules in matured (filled) kernels from the ISS is significantly longer than in kernels from the ground experiment (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Also, the length and width of type B granules in puny kernels from Earth were significantly smaller. The roundness indices are the same within all types of granules, as well as the width of type A granules.</p><p>The ratio of starch granules type A and B affects the baking properties of flour. An analysis of the ratio of granules showed that in kernels from the ISS there is 5% less type B starch in mature kernels than in the control ground variant, as well as in puny kernels&#8212;the difference with the Earth is 8% (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-f005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). In general, the distribution of the two types of granules in kernels from the Earth treatment was close to an equal ratio, but in kernels from the ISS there was a significant bias towards type A granules.</p><p>Cells of the aleurone layer in wheat kernels from the ground treatment and from the ISS did not have significant differences in length (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, the width of the cells in mature kernels from the ISS was significantly smaller (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>When analyzing the qualitative characteristics of starch granules, median sections differing in shape, aspect ratio, and the presence of extensions in the central part of the kernel were used. The ratio of sizes, number of starch granules of various types, and their location are associated with varietal characteristics, predicted flour quality, cultivation characteristics, and the presence of pests. Due to the fact that under space flight conditions, as in laboratory conditions, the main control indicators such as humidity, lighting, nutrition were the same, and pests and diseases were not identified, it can be assumed that the differences could be caused by the specific location of the greenhouse. The shape, the ratio of the number of starch granules, as well as the binder and matrix, which is the remains of the cytoplasm, are indicators of the quality of the resulting flour and starch.</p><p>The starch granules in the endosperm of the kernels had a structural organization characteristic of wheat. Large starch granules were inclusions formed in plastids and they formed a flat spindle-shaped structure, which was expressed in depressions located along the widest part. Smaller grains are also formed in plastids and their quantity affects the quality of starch and, therefore, flour. The forming granules in fully completed kernels under terrestrial conditions had a smooth surface with a depression on the side and smaller starch inclusions of type B. In kernels that have impaired development and pronounced asymmetry of the two sides, apparently associated with the peculiarities of formation, lack of nutrients, local disruption of the supply of nutrients, some disturbances in the shape, and ratio of starch granules deposits could be observed.</p><p>Under cultivation conditions in ISS, small changes in shape in the granules, and significant disturbances in the quantity, ratio of granule types, and sizes in granules with an uneven and incompletely formed system of deposition of reserve substances was observed (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-f006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). A breakdown of the binding components could also be observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-plants-13-00073"><title>2.6.

Discussion</title><p>Providing for people during long space expeditions, when working on remote objects of deep and near space, poses significant challenges for agronomic support and necessarily encourage the creation of water reclamation systems, efficient use of nutrients, and a closed cycle of plant cultivation with mandatory reproduction of plant crops from seed to seed [<xref rid="B6-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B19-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>For the first time, this study describes a comparison of Super Dwarf wheat grown in a growth chamber in near space conditions on the ISS with wheat grown in a growth chamber on Earth. The Lada chamber was carefully designed so that the main difference between the treatments was gravity. The ISS-grown plants appeared visually normal, likely because phototropism responses under both treatments were similar. Since no major morphological changes in plant growth were observed, the accumulative effects of gravity were evaluated in the kernels produced under the two treatment conditions. Because the experiment could not be replicated, detailed studies were conducted to determine if differences between kernels produced in the two environments exist. However, the nature of those studies was restricted by both small sizes and non-damaging evaluations. It has been found that the simple scanning of a scattering of kernels is not suitable for a non-traumatic method of asymmetry determination. The presence of asymmetry can be detected by measuring the length of the left and right parts of the kernel, scanning (or photographing under a microscope) the base of the kernel. That is, of the two proposed methods, only the second is suitable&#8212;measuring the lengths of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry through the point of attachment of the kernel and the zone of closure of the two lobes of the kernel. It was found that the weight, area, length, and width of the kernels from the plants grown in the ISS are less than those in the ground control, with statistically identical perimeters and roundness. Hypothesis A, that all parameters would be significantly lower, was put forward, but the hypothesis was only partially confirmed. A similar phenomenon was observed in a study of Arabidopsis seed coats&#8212;the size and number of cells inside the seed coat were statistically the same [<xref rid="B20-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], as well as the number of lettuce leaves [<xref rid="B14-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Also, the hypothesis regarding the distortion of the shape of the kernel (Hypotheses B and C) were not confirmed, although early studies mentioned various types of deviations, for example, chromosome breakage [<xref rid="B21-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], inability to produce seeds [<xref rid="B22-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], distorted and non-viable embryos [<xref rid="B24-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], and morphological abnormalities [<xref rid="B25-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. This might be due to improved systems for growing plants&#8212;improved ventilation and watering systems.</p><p>There are usually two types of starch granules in wheat kernels&#8212;A-type and B-type. They vary in size, shape, and composition. Thus, A-type starch granules have a biconvex shape; their size is more than 10 &#956;m and they contain more amylose than B-type granules. The second type of granule is typically round in shape and size &lt;10 &#956;m [<xref rid="B26-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Granules are widely present in the starchy endosperm of the kernel, where they are located within a protein matrix. In our study, this was also confirmed by the granule roundness indices. We have found that the length of starch granules in kernels from the ISS was significantly longer than that from accessions in the terrestrial treatment. Perhaps, this can be partially explained by the reaction of plants to small doses of stress, as was shown in the work with the influence of low salt concentrations on kernel parameters [<xref rid="B30-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The baking properties of wheat are closely related to the composition (two types of glucose polymer, amylose, and amylopectin), structure, and morphology of starch granules, as well as storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) of the grain, which determine the viscoelastic properties of the dough [<xref rid="B31-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In mature endosperm, protein content is higher at the periphery of the kernel and decreases towards the central part (kernel cavity), and starch granules accumulate in exactly the opposite direction [<xref rid="B33-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In a number of studies, the kernel was divided into nine successive layers (pearling method) and confirmed that differences in the spatial distribution of chemical components affect the quality of flour. Thus, bread from layers 3&#8211;6 had a higher loaf volume, specific volume, elasticity, and organoleptic characteristics [<xref rid="B34-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Our study revealed that there are more type B granules in terrestrial experience; that is, it can be assumed that kernels from the ISS will be slightly inferior in baking quality. Also, changes in starch content under the conditions of space were reported in works on the seeds of <italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> [<xref rid="B8-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], pepper plants [<xref rid="B36-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and on the roots of the watercress <italic toggle="yes">Lepidium sativum</italic> L.

In our work, in the ripened wheat grains on the ISS, the width of the aleurone layer cells was significantly smaller in matured wheat kernels from the ISS (Hypothesis D was confirmed) than in the terrestrial experiment; therefore, they like have less of the protein component. Reduced protein levels in <italic toggle="yes">Brassica rapa</italic> seeds obtained under space station conditions were previously reported [<xref rid="B8-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B35-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Also, <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> seeds had 54.73% fewer protein bodies than the ground control [<xref rid="B20-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Researchers believe this is due to the harsh conditions of microgravity, such as increased ethylene content. The lack of natural ventilation in growth chambers can easily lead plants to oxygen starvation [<xref rid="B38-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and, as a consequence, to seed hypoxia. Some symptoms of oxygen deficiency are a reduction of protein bodies, abnormal deposition of starch granules, and thickening of cell walls [<xref rid="B39-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>When analyzing the qualitative differences between kernels obtained on Earth and in the ISS, both symmetrical and asymmetrical kernels were used with an emphasis on the starch inclusions of the endosperm, which are an indicator of the quality of starch and flour for wheat. No significant differences were found in the size and arrangement of starch grains in fully developed symmetrical kernels grown both on Earth and in space flight conditions. However, differences were observed both in the connecting elements of cytoplasmic residues and in the size, location, and ratio of A and B starch inclusions in kernels with manifested asymmetry. It can be argued that if optimal conditions are created under which developmental disorders will be absent, the quality of grain and flour will not differ from those on Earth. It is possible that the cause of this phenomenon may be the peculiarities of the manifestation of the physical properties of water in weightlessness, which do not allow us to completely simulate this phenomenon. Thus, the availability of water for plants and the technical device for its provision can be key indicators for yield obtaining under space flight conditions. This is confirmed by the changes in the epidermis and hairs on the surface that we described earlier [<xref rid="B19-plants-13-00073" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In the future, prospects are seen in accelerating the determination of the asymmetry of kernels by introducing computer scanning and developing a system for placing grains in a vertical position. We also consider it promising to study the relationship between the chemical composition of the seeds and the asymmetry of the fruits using hyperspectral and computer scanning methods. The small differences in kernel characteristics observed in two treatments to which wheat plants are poorly adapted, constant temperature, 24 h light, and low gravity, suggests that wheat cultivars better adapted to non-earth conditions would be relatively easy to breed. Such plants would be better adapted to space conditions and would not require some genes involved in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Because some of the genes used to limit crop losses on the earth do have adverse effects on plant vigor.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-13-00073"><title>4.

Wherein, the kernels were not turned over. Images were acquired at 600 dpi resolution. The kernel may fall onto the scanning surface sideways or onto the area where the two sides of the endosperm meet (crease), taking into account the uneven balance of weight inside the kernel. If it falls to one side, it will not be possible to establish asymmetry, since the symmetry line of the crease will not be reflected correctly (<xref rid="plants-13-00073-f013" ref-type="fig">Figure 13</xref>).

Reflectance coefficient (r) is the ratio of reflected radiation to incident radiation in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The reflectance in a certain direction relative to the Earth&#8217;s surface is called spectral albedo.</p><p>The NDVI index (normalized relative vegetation index)&#8212;a simple indicator of the amount of photosynthetically active biomass&#8212;was calculated using the formula (800 nm &#8722; 680 nm)/(800 nm + 680 nm). Vegetation index values range from 0.20 to 0.95.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5-plants-13-00073"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The work presents, for the first time, data on the asymmetry of wheat kernels obtained in near space conditions, and also indicates the relationship of this parameter with other important characteristics of the kernel. It has been found that there were no significant differences between the main parameters of the kernels from the wheat plants grown on the ISS and on Earth. The number of type B starch granules in kernels from ISS was 5&#8211;8% less than in those obtained on Earth, and the width of the cells of the aleurone layer in kernels from ISS was significantly inferior to that obtained on Earth. Despite the fact that many parameters of the grains were statistically the same, a decrease in the protein component in the endosperm indicates a likely increase in stress components, gravity loss, water stress, and possibly some tissue hypoxia during the formation of space generation seeds; therefore, the growth chambers should be modified for better aeration.</p><p>It should be noted that growing plants from seeds in space opens up prospects for sustainable food production and the stability of artificially created ecosystems not only during long space flights, but also in other closed-cycle conditions; for example, when creating stationary systems with extreme conditions on other planets, at base stations in the Arctic and Antarctic, high mountain areas, or at underground or underwater objects. The data presented make it possible to obtain valuable information about the asymmetry of the shape, protein, and starch composition of the kernel in the space environment. Continued research in this area will contribute to the development of space agriculture and the creation of a self-sustaining space habitat. The phototropic responses of plants are likely the main factor preventing drastic gravitational responses in space.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Thanks to: Roscosmos and cosmonaut Sergey Volkov.
