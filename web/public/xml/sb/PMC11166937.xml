Here, using single-cell analysis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)&#160;exposed to short term (25&#8201;hours) simulated microgravity, we characterize altered genes and pathways at basal and stimulated states with a Toll-like Receptor-7/8 agonist. We validate single-cell analysis by RNA sequencing and super-resolution microscopy, and against data from the Inspiration-4 (I4) mission, JAXA (Cell-Free Epigenome) mission, Twins study, and spleens from mice on the International Space Station. Overall, microgravity alters specific pathways for optimal immunity, including the cytoskeleton, interferon signaling, pyroptosis, temperature-shock, innate inflammation (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway and IL-6 signaling), nuclear receptors, and sirtuin signaling. Microgravity directs monocyte inflammatory parameters, and impairs T cell and NK cell functionality. Using machine learning, we identify numerous compounds linking microgravity to immune cell transcription, and demonstrate that the flavonol, quercetin, can reverse most abnormal pathways. These results define immune cell alterations in microgravity, and provide opportunities for countermeasures to maintain normal immunity in space.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">The phenotype and function of immune cells could change during spaceflight. Here the authors use simulated microgravity, coupled to validation with spaceflight data, to assess whether there are distinct gene expression changes in resting and TLR 7/8 stimulated PBMCs and found conserved changes in IFN signalling, the cytoskeleton, IL-6 and sirtuin signalling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Adaptive immunity</kwd><kwd>Innate immunity</kwd><kwd>Gene regulation in immune cells</kwd><kwd>Space physics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>This work was supported in part through funds derived from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging (D.A.W., D.F.), and the Huiying Memorial Foundation (D.A.W.).

These findings suggest that under simulated microgravity, cells display reduced differentiation states in response to stimulation.</p><p id="Par14">IPA results (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media">5</xref>) generated using our core list of approximately 317 genes from the overall populations, as well as the DEGs in major immune cell types (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM9" ref-type="media">6</xref>) demonstrated that nearly all immune cells show changes across numerous pathways during microgravity and TLR7/8 induction. Major pathways reduced across most immune cells in simulated microgravity included PKR in interferon response (and associated eif2 signaling), interferon signaling, JAK/STAT signaling, pyroptosis signaling, cytotoxic T cell mediated killing of target cells and death receptor signaling. Major pathways induced by short term simulated microgravity included sirtuin signaling, fibrosis signaling, signaling by Rho GTPases, BAG2 (heat-shock protein 70 interactor) signaling, HIF1&#945; signaling, acute phase response and associated HMGB1 signaling, amongst others. These pathways are consistent with microgravity facilitating innate like inflammation at the expense of interferon driven adaptive immunity and adaptive immune effector function (e.g., CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing). Despite some similarities in pathways altered to simulated microgravity alone (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>), we actually detected a lower iAge score globally across all immune populations in simulated microgravity plus TLR7/8 compared to 1G controls (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). While the reason for this finding is unclear, it appears to have been driven by a highly significant reduction in score by naive B cells, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and reductions in lesser studied PBMC populations, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC)s and double negative T cells. Lower iAge also could be reflective of altered immune activation in simulated microgravity, such as seen in CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, right panel). Despite a reduction in iAge, we still observed an increased SenMayo score in simulated PBMCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">8</xref>), illustrating different compositions of genes in these two gene sets.<fig id="Fig4" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Simulated microgravity induces predictive functional alterations in immune cells following TLR7/8 stimulation.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Differences in iAge index between all cell types (left) and across 19 individual immune cell types (right) after TLR7/8 agonist activation in&#160;1G or simulated uG.

Compared to the unstimulated interactome (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D&#8211;F</xref>), we saw increased production and diversity of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines used. We again noted IL-1 produced in APCs, but also noted increased TNF superfamily products like TNF, TNFSF12 (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis, TWEAK) and TNFSF15 (vascular endothelial growth inhibitor, VEGI), and lymphotoxin (LTA) preferentially produced to modulate T cell function.</p><p id="Par16">Next, we assessed the differential responsiveness of immune cells to TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref> and Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM10" ref-type="media">7</xref>). Under 1G conditions, stimulation led to a marked induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> TCM, at the expense of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes and CD4<sup>+</sup> naive T cells, coupled to an expected pronounced inflammatory gene signature, including marked induction of interferon inducible genes, <italic toggle="yes">gbp</italic> transcripts, and chemokines across most immune cell populations (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12A&#8211;E</xref>). Under simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced CD4<sup>+</sup> TCM, at the expense of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, though proportions of CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte populations did not reduce as seen in 1G (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12F, G</xref>). In simulated microgravity, TLR7/8 stimulation also induced a robust expression of inflammatory genes, including interferon inducing genes across most cell types (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12H&#8211;J</xref>). Next, to determine the sensitivity of individual immune cell populations to TLR7/8 agonist in 1G vs simulated microgravity, we compared the differences in responsiveness to stimulation. We subtracted the fold change induction in 1G from induction in simulated microgravity to determine sensitivity to stimulation. Remarkably, across overall immune cells, we see a pattern of reduced responsiveness to TLR7/8 simulation in simulated microgravity to most of the highest genes induced at 1G (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13A</xref>), with T cells and NK cells showing the most reduced inflammatory gene induction. T cells, NK cells, and overall across all cells exhibited blunting of induction of numerous genes in interferon signaling, and <italic toggle="yes">gbp</italic> genes in simulated microgravity in response to TLR7/8 agonist. Interestingly, monocytes tended to maintain such responses better in simulated microgravity, consistent with their predisposition to some inflammatory pathways in simulated microgravity. Some chemokines, such as <italic toggle="yes">ccl3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ccl4</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ccl8</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">cxcl10</italic> appeared to be induced better in simulated uG across overall immune cell populations, though monocytes actually showed reduced induction of some of these chemokines, likely due to their capacity to produce them in simulated microgravity without stimulation (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>). Nonetheless, the overall effects in sensitivity to stimulation in the &#8220;overall&#8221; category of immune cells largely followed the same pattern seen in the total magnitude of response of stimulated microgravity vs stimulated 1G (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Next, we sought to identify genes uniquely altered by simulated microgravity irrespective of stimulation, as well as genes unique to microgravity under stimulation. First, to identify unique genes, regardless of stimulation, altered by simulated microgravity, we plotted out the most significant DEGs by the absolute sum of fold change under both stimulated and unstimulated conditions (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13B</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM11" ref-type="media">8</xref>). Across overall immune cells, regardless of stimulation, we still identified conserved increases in chemokines and acute response factors, coupled to reduced <italic toggle="yes">gbp</italic> expression and other interferon genes (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">irf1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">stat1</italic>) imparted by simulated microgravity. Next, we mapped out the overall overlap of gene signatures and common genes between post-stimulation in 1G vs simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13C&#8211;E</xref> and Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM12" ref-type="media">9</xref>), and found that microgravity imparts a number of unique genes to TLR ligation that are not seen in 1G. Overall, these findings identify core-conserved DEGs specifically sensitive to simulated microgravity as well as unique signatures to simulated microgravity.</p><p id="Par18">Finally, we assessed if sex plays a role in the magnitude of response to simulated microgravity. In the unstimulated state, female cells showed only slightly more DEGs induced, while the male cells had slightly more genes reduced (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14A</xref>). Male NK cells and monocytes were more sensitive to microgravity while female B cells showed more sensitivity than male B cells. Upon stimulation, male cells overall were more sensitive to simulated microgravity, especially in having more downregulated DEGs (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14B</xref>). Volcano plots of DEGs across all cell types between the female and male are shown in Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14C&#8211;F</xref> and Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM13" ref-type="media">10</xref>.

Upon stimulation, both sexes again show increases in the total magnitude of acute inflammatory, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related, and acute phase genes like chemokines, <italic toggle="yes">thbs1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">mmp9</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ncf1,</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">sod2</italic> in simulated microgravity coupled to reduced interferon, <italic toggle="yes">gbp</italic>s, cold shock, and some ribosomal protein genes in simulated microgravity. Many of these changes are reflected in IPA pathway analysis by sex (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14G</xref>) and many of these core features were also conserved when data from sexes were pooled (Figs.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1F</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Single-cell validation identifies core features of immune dysfunction in microgravity and spaceflight</title><p id="Par19">Next, to better validate conserved genes and pathways from our single-cell signatures without TLR7/8 agonist in simulated microgravity, we compared our core signature of 375 DEGs against additional datasets. First, we repeated experiments in a validation cohort of freshly isolated PBMCs from young donors (<italic toggle="yes">n</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;6, age range 20&#8211;46), and spun these PBMCs for 25&#8201;hours, prior to performing bulk RNA-seq analysis. Using CIBERSORTx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, we first mapped predicted changes in population frequency and were able to confirm increased CD14<sup>+</sup> monocyte frequencies in simulated microgravity, consistent with our single-cell data (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM14" ref-type="media">11</xref>). Between validation samples spun in simulated microgravity vs 1G controls, we identified 2149 genes differentially expressed (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM15" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Despite the variability of data inherent to bulk RNA-seq of different populations of cells between donors, we still saw a highly significant correlation in normalized gene counts per specific gene between datasets both at 1G and in simulated microgravity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>). Moreover, we identified overlap in over 28% of our core signature genes (same directionality) across all immune cells from our single-cell analysis (106/375&#8201;=&#8201;28.3%) (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5C</xref>). Many of the overlapping genes induced were consistent with our most robustly altered core pathways from the single-cell data.

While multiple stressors exist in LEO, the proximity to Earth and the presence of the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field negates some effects of galactic cosmic rays, especially at the altitude of the ISS. Thus, microgravity plays an important role in driving phenotypic changes in LEO. To accomplish this goal, we first mined data from NASA&#8217;s GeneLab database for its largest study looking at a major immune organ, the spleen, in mice flown on the ISS. The GLDS-420 study provides data from the spleens of ten mice housed on the ISS for 33 days compared to ten ground controls. Though this cohort represents longer exposure to microgravity than our single-cell data&#8217;s more acute exposure, any overlapping genes could represent persistent microgravity-sensitive immune cell genes across longer duration exposure. From the GLDS-420 dataset, we identified 1448 significant DEGs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5D</xref>), of which 50/375 (13.3%) overlapped in the same direction as our single-cell core list (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Interestingly, many of the overlapping genes were represented as part of altered core pathways from the single-cell data. For instance, we saw shared induced overlapping genes in acute immune responses or complement (such as <italic toggle="yes">c3</italic>), autophagy (<italic toggle="yes">atg7</italic>), heat-shock responses (<italic toggle="yes">hsp90ab1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">hsp90aa1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">hspa1a</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">hspa1</italic>), and the cytoskeleton (<italic toggle="yes">dynll1</italic>). Overlapping reduced genes included interferon response (<italic toggle="yes">stat1</italic>), and again, cold shock genes (<italic toggle="yes">cirbp</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rbm3</italic>), amongst others. Overall, we saw a significant enrichment in our core single-cell DEGs across mouse spleens flown in space by Fisher&#8217;s Exact Test for gene overlap (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5E</xref>). Pathway analysis with IPA was next performed to identify major canonical pathways altered across all four complete datasets (single-cell unstimulated, single-cell stimulated with TLR7/8 agonist, Bulk RNA-seq validation unstimulated, and GLDS-420), including overlapping pathways shared across all datasets. These pathways are displayed in a heat map for comparison (see below), and will be described at that point.</p><p id="Par21">To better translate the usefulness of our single-cell atlas to human spaceflight, we compared our core list of 375 DEGs across single cells in simulated microgravity to changes across all single cells from the Inspiration Four (I4) crew members. The I4 mission provides a compelling comparison since crew members spent up to three days in LEO, a timeline not too different from our 25-hour time point. Moreover, I4 gene lists were also generated by single-cell sequencing, making it a comparable technology for our analysis. However, it is important to note that the I4 datasets contain a few important caveats. First, the altitude flown by I4 crew (585&#8201;km/364miles) predispose the astronauts to higher radiation exposures than what would typically be experienced on the ISS (408&#8201;km/254miles altitude). Additionally, the I4 datasets were derived from PBMC gene expression comparisons between post-flight (1 day after Return/R&#8201;+&#8201;1 in our case) vs preflight (44 days before launch/L-44&#160;in our case). Since the changes from the I4 single-cell data represent changes encompassing effects of spaceflight, plus return to the ground, including short-term exposures to hyper-gravity, and one day of return to 1&#8201;g gravity (all which manifest as increased gravity exposure to inflight conditions), we considered overlapping immune cell genes in either direction on return to be gravity sensitive genes. Remarkably, despite these caveats, we found a very robust overlap of nearly 60% of DEGs in PBMCs in simulated microgravity (210/375&#8201;=&#8201;56%) to be also significantly altered across all immune cells in the I4 mission (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM16" ref-type="media">13</xref>). Of these significantly altered genes across I4 data, 122 were altered in the same direction as I4 data, and 88 in the opposite direction. To gain a better understanding of the pathways and mechanisms impacted by gravity and spaceflight in the immune system, we compared pathways between simulated microgravity and the entire I4 dataset (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">14</xref>, and Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16A</xref>). While we consider all of these pathways to be potentially gravity sensitive, we considered pathways altered in the opposite directions to be potentially acutely sensitive to gravity, while those pathways altered in the same direction likely take longer to normalize from a microgravity environment upon return.</p><p id="Par22">Both simulated microgravity and the I4 mission pathway results indicated reduced T-cell effector subset development, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and increased pathways associated with innate immunity (e.g., Coronavirus pathogenesis, FcR phagocytosis in monocytes, cytokine storm, chemokine signaling, ROS production in macrophages), as well as hypoxia and glycolytic metabolism (HIF1&#945; signaling) and cell stress (e.g., sirtuin signaling). Interestingly, the return to gravity seen in the I4 mission reversed reductions in natural killer cell signaling and reversed pathways linked to poor adaptive immunity like IL-15 signaling, suggesting these pathways may be sensitive to acute changes in gravity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5G</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM17" ref-type="media">14</xref>). From the I4 dataset, we also noticed a consistent reduction in ribosomal subunit genes in the I4 data (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5F</xref>), which might be reflective of a stress response and reduced protein translation upon return to earth), and only some of these genes were reduced in simulated microgravity. Consistently, there was a marked reduction in EIF2 signaling in the provided I4 DEGs. Across all pathways, regardless of direction, we noticed many pathways pertaining to the cytoskeleton or to a mechanical extracellular environment (e.g., fibrosis, RAC, Rho family GTPases, RHOA, integrin signaling, leukocyte extravasation signaling, healing signaling etc.) to be altered by simulated microgravity or by spaceflight on immune cells.</p><p id="Par23">Next, to look for overlapping genes relevant to longer exposures to human spaceflight, we compared our core simulated microgravity signature of immune cells against available data from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome study in LEO (GLDS-530) and the Twins study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. For the JAXA mission, we had access to cell-free RNA data, which can sometimes give insight into changes to PBMCs, amongst other cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. During this mission, blood was sampled from 6 astronauts, with data pooled into a single count, at days 5, 30, 60, 120 post launch. Given that cell-free RNA is not a fully ideal comparison to RNA-seq from isolated PBMCs, we focused only on the two early time points, 5 days and 30 days post launch, because we saw significant overlap between our single-cell data in both the three-day I4 mission and in the 33-day GLDS-420 dataset. Thus, we compared 5 days and 30 days in-flight vs preflight differentially altered cell free RNA signatures for any possible overlap with our single-cell data in simulated microgravity. While we did not observe much overlap in our core 375 immune gene signature at 5 days (less than 10 genes), we did see significant overlap by 30 days (42/375&#8201;=&#8201;11.2% overlap in the same direction) (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">16B</xref>). Interestingly, it was observed that cell-free RNA levels generally decreased across most genes in flight. Consequently, we hypothesized that identifying genes exhibiting increased expression could be particularly important for identifying over-represented processes. Remarkably, we did note that the most significantly elevated gene at 30 days in-flight vs preflight was <italic toggle="yes">cdc42</italic>, a key modulator of the cytoskeleton, as well as <italic toggle="yes">dynll1</italic> a dynein gene that was also upregulated in our single-cell analysis.</p><p id="Par24">We next reclustered our single-cell data (Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM18" ref-type="media">15</xref>) to compare the DEGs in our equivalent single-cell populations with those obtained from sorted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, and lymphocyte-depleted immune cells from the NASA Twins study, which compares in-flight vs ground twin control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The Twins study provides intriguing data on the impact of LEO on the immune system, but has caveats in that exposure to LEO was calculated in only a single individual through bulk RNA-seq, and at multiple time points across one full year in space, a different duration than our shorter gene sets. Nonetheless, compared to our reclustered CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>, and CD19<sup>+</sup> gene sets, we found significant overlap in some genes comparing the effects of simulated microgravity to spaceflight (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17A&#8211;C</xref>). Across multiple cell types, we saw changes in genes involved in redox regulation (e.g., reduced <italic toggle="yes">txnip</italic>), and in genes involved in interferon responses (e.g., reduced <italic toggle="yes">stat1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">gbp5</italic>). Interestingly, we saw significantly reduced cold shock gene, <italic toggle="yes">cirbp</italic>, a similar functioning gene to <italic toggle="yes">rbm3</italic>, in B cells in space. In our lymphocyte depleted (i.e., myeloid) recluster, we saw a large and highly significant overlap of about 163 genes with the Twins lymphocyte-depleted bulk RNA-seq data (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17D</xref>). Many of the overlapping genes induced by simulated microgravity or spaceflight included genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">il1b</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">s100a12</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">thbs1</italic> etc.), the cytoskeleton (<italic toggle="yes">rhoq</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">rhou</italic>), and hypoxia signaling (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">hif1&#945;</italic>).

IPA analysis on this data largely captured the increases in innate immune inflammatory pathways, including increases in fibrosis signaling, IL-6 signaling, acute phase response, cytokine storm, and HIF1&#945; signaling seen across some of our previous datasets (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">17E</xref>, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM19" ref-type="media">16</xref>). Overall, these data enforce the idea of classically activated basal myeloid inflammatory changes in microgravity and spaceflight.</p><p id="Par25">Given that many of our altered pathways in simulated microgravity involved predicted mitochondrial dysfunction and/or the cytoskeleton, we used Airyscan super-resolution confocal microscopy to characterize immune cell mitochondrial and actin morphological networks to look for alterations in simulated microgravity compared to 1G controls. Interestingly, while 25&#8201;hours of simulated microgravity did not alter mean cell area across PBMCs, it did alter actin granularity parameters, as well as intensity and variance, consistent with cytoskeletal changes in acute simulated microgravity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A&#8211;C</xref>), though these differences are mostly subtle to the naked eye. Using three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution imaging, 25&#8201;hours of simulated microgravity did not alter cell or nucleus volume, or nucleus shape, but it increased mean cell surface area and actin spike length, and decreased sphericity of the cells across PBMCs (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A, B, D</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18A, B</xref>). Remarkably, 1G immune cells and simulated microgravity immune cells demonstrate unique spectral changes to actin rearrangement post TLR stimulation, such that TLR stimulation resulted in a different pattern of actin granularity spectral change in 1G compared to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6C</xref>). The effect of microgravity on the cytoskeleton in unstimulated immune cells was similar to the effect of TLR activation in 1G. During TLR stimulation in simulated microgravity, immune cells followed a unique dynamic actin rearrangement pattern, potentially even reversing the pattern observed in 1G with TLR stimulation. These results suggest that simulated microgravity itself may induce immune cytoskeleton alterations, which may mimic aspects of TLR ligation on the cytoskeleton. Short-term exposure to simulated microgravity showed some increases in the&#160;mitochondrial MitoTracker Red staining intensity and variance in the unstimulated conditions, without changes to fiber length, size, or volume (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18C</xref>).<fig id="Fig6" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><title>Simulated microgravity induces distinct modifications to immune cell cytoskeletal morphology and cytokine production.</title><p><bold>A</bold> Super-resolution microscopy analysis of actin in 2D for&#160;cell area (left), intensity (middle), and texture as&#160;punctate over&#160;diffuse index (PDI, variance/mean, right) between 25&#8201;hours of 1G or simulated uG.

After 25&#8201;hours of simulated microgravity, regardless of stimulation conditions, we saw elevated levels of active GTP-bound Cdc42, consistent with cytoskeleton mobilization and the increase in actin spikes (indicative of filopodia)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> observed due to simulated microgravity (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6E</xref>). Active GTP-Rac1 was not altered at baseline in simulated microgravity, though showed a trend to induction with TLR7/8 stimulation (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18D, E</xref>). Levels of active GTP-RhoA were low in our samples, but trended lower in simulated microgravity without stimulation, and higher under stimulation, analogous to our single-cell data predictions (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">18D, E</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that simulated microgravity changes some Rho GTPase activity consistent with our transcriptional data, though ultimate impacts on cytoskeleton shape, variance, and dynamics likely involve additional contributing factors, including possibly other Rho GTPase family members not assessed.</p><p id="Par27">We next sought to investigate our core signature of reduced IFN signaling elicited in microgravity across immune cells (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>, Supplemental Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19A, B</xref>). Specifically, we assessed whether reduced interferon signaling was due to reduced local production of interferons. Supernatants from 25&#8201;hours unstimulated or 9&#8201;hours R848 simulated (25&#8201;hours total culture) PBMCs were assessed by ELISA for total IFN&#945; (detecting 12 IFN&#945; subtypes), and IFN&#947;. Simulated microgravity significantly reduced both IFN&#945; and IFN&#947; secretion with TLR7/8 stimulation. At baseline, the levels of these cytokines were low, and variable, and thus not significantly different between 1G and simulated microgravity. These findings point to reduced production of IFNs in simulated microgravity, at least under TLR stimulation, as measured by ELISA, potentially as one contributing mechanism to reduced interferon signaling observed at the transcriptional level.</p><p id="Par28">Finally, to functionally validate how simulated microgravity impacts overall immune cell cytokine production, with and without TLR7/8 stimulation, across many cytokines simultaneously, we performed a 48-plex Luminex assay on cytokines secreted by PBMCs from 12 donors (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19C, D</xref>). Consistent with our single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data, simulated microgravity was associated with increased or trending increases in mainly innate/monocyte immune cell-derived inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-12p40, CCL4), coupled to a reduction in cytokines that associate with T cell activation or proliferation (e.g., IL-2, IL-7, IL-15). Concurrently, the Luminex results showed a significant IFN&#947; and a trending IFN&#945;2 reduction upon TLR7/8 agonist stimulation in simulated microgravity, consistent with our above ELISA data (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6F</xref>). IL-1, commonly induced in our sequencing data, also appeared elevated in simulated microgravity, though it exhibited high variability, precluding significance in the unstimulated state. In the stimulated state, IL-1&#946; was significantly increased in simulated microgravity by Luminex analysis. Given the overlapping similarities between cytokines in the Luminex data and sequencing data for IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IL-8, we further assessed these cytokines by ELISA validation. Both IL-6 and IL-8 showed significant or near-significant increases by ELISA in simulated microgravity, while IL-1&#946; demonstrated a trending increase (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6G</xref>, Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19E</xref>). Upon stimulation, simulated microgravity further facilitated near-significant increases in IL-1&#946; and IL-8 as validated by ELISA (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">19F</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">To better understand how certain cell populations respond to TLR7/8 stimulation in simulated microgravity, we further validated key cytokines, IL-1&#946;, IL-6, and IFN&#947;, by intracellular flow cytometry in monocyte, NK, and T cell subsets exposed to simulated microgravity compared to 1G conditions (Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">20</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21</xref>). Consistent with Luminex and ELISA data, we saw increased IL-1&#946; production across all characterized monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21A, B</xref>). Interestingly, despite no overall differences in IL-6 by Luminex or ELISA in simulated microgravity to TLR7/8 stimulation, we still detected significant increases in a subset of monocytes only, as well as in NK cells (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21C, E</xref>). Despite increased cytokine production, we did not detect increases in the activation marker, HLA-DR, in monocyte populations (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21D</xref>). NK cells also showed a reduction in the proportion producing IFN&#947;, as well as reduced proportions of expression in the activation marker, CD69, and degranulation marker, LAMP-1, consistent with reduced functionality and response to stimulation in simulated microgravity (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21F, G</xref>). T cell subsets were less altered, though we still detected near significant or significant reductions in the proportions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> central memory T cells expressing activation marker, CD69, and in effector memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells expressing proliferation marker, Ki67 (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">21H</xref>). Taken together with our ELISA and Luminex data, these findings demonstrate that simulated microgravity, alone or in the presence of TLR7/8 agonist, can functionally alter cytokine production across immune cells. In general, consistent with sequencing data, the features demonstrate monocyte inflammatory function coupled to impaired T cell and NK cell functionality in simulated microgravity. Thus, changes in cytokine signaling observed in simulated microgravity may occur at least in part to changes in upstream cytokine production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reversing simulated microgravity effects on the immune system</title><p id="Par30">We have characterized multiple genes and pathways altered by simulated microgravity in the immune system; however, whether there are specific drugs or supplements that can directly target microgravity effects on immune cells is poorly characterized.

Overall, we noted changes consistent with basal innate immune cell inflammatory changes in simulated microgravity, coupled with distinct pathways of dysfunction in multiple immune cells. Specifically, the most consistently reproduced pathways impacted by simulated microgravity across immune cells in both single-cell and validation cohorts included changes to pathways and signaling linked to acute phase response signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis, IL-6 signaling, the cytoskeleton, interferon response, pyroptosis, heat-shock, nuclear receptors, and sirtuin biology.</p><p id="Par36">The link between the cytoskeleton and other pathways here may be especially relevant in immune dysfunction. Cytoskeleton dynamics are controlled by a number of factors, but small GTPases, including Ras homology (Rho) GTPases, are major orchestrators with critical impact on immune cell function, migration, gene expression, trafficking, phagocytosis, proliferation, and antigen recognition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Of note, Rho GTPases have been implicated in response to simulated microgravity in other cell types, but this connection is understudied in immune cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Across most datasets, we saw changes to Rho GTPase signaling, including individually in RAC, RHOA, or CDC42 signaling, or combined in a global &#8220;regulation of actin-based motility by Rho&#8221; pathway in IPA. While we did notice some variability between our initial unstimulated vs stimulated single-cell data in these pathways, these pathways tended to show reduced RHOA signaling without stimulation, coupled with increased RAC signaling, analogous to what we observed from the I4 crew members upon landing. The JAXA6 dataset also demonstrated <italic toggle="yes">cdc42</italic> to be the most significantly induced cell-free transcript in astronauts after 30 days in space. Pathways strongly linked to cytoskeletal remodeling, such as leukocyte extravasation, were also typically induced in most of our datasets. We also observed changes in some active Rho GTPases by G-LISA, as well as in F-actin granularity, variance, 3D surface area, sphericity, actin protrusion length, and dynamic change to TLR stimulation by super-resolution microscopy, providing further evidence for changes in actin, including possibly immune cytoskeleton alteration or dysfunction, in simulated microgravity.</p><p id="Par37">Importantly, changes to the actin cytoskeleton are now being linked to the ability of an immune cell to mount an interferon response. Indeed, danger-sensing molecules like TLRs utilize Rho GTPases to facilitate IFN responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, or antiviral sensors can directly modulate actin rearrangement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. One example is the PKR antiviral response, which was consistently downregulated by simulated microgravity in our datasets. In this system, PKR binds gelsolin to enforce basal innate immune defense, though upon viral sensing, PKR dissociates from gelsolin, leading to the severing of actin, and activation of RIG-I-like receptor (RLR)s signaling and interferon response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Other antiviral sensors like RIG-I directly bind F-actin in resting cells, and then relocalize to the mitochondria via actin rearrangements on viral infection, to induce type 1 IFN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In single-cell data, reduced interferon signaling without stimulation was seen mainly in monocytes, linking it to innate immunity, though with TLR7/8 stimulation, reduced interferon signaling was seen across many cells, including most T cell subsets, and NK cells, displaying the broad importance of this pathway across most immune cells to microgravity. In simulated microgravity, we saw reduced IFN&#945; production by ELISA with stimulation, so we cannot rule out the possibility that the reduced IFN signaling seen in simulated microgravity starts with reduced capacity for IFN production in some conditions, in addition to potential defects in downstream signaling itself. While we have focused on type 1 IFN signaling, some reduced interferon responses are also linked to reduced signaling from the IFN gamma receptor (IFNGR). Consistently, we also noted reduced IFN&#947; production in simulated microgravity upon TLR7/8 stimulation. Whether the cytoskeleton is needed for IFNGR clustering and signaling remains to be seen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par38">Consistent with reduced interferon signaling in simulated microgravity, we noticed a reduction in some IFN-inducible GTPase superfamily genes, namely guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) across our datasets.

While analysis of our datasets cannot rule out this possibility, we did not observe increased Th2 signatures across our simulated microgravity systems, or with our specific gene sets validated across the I4 mission.

This algorithm focuses on the strength of interaction and does not specify direction. However, we tested one of the most significantly interacting compounds, the flavonol, quercetin, for its ability to reverse transcriptional changes to simulated microgravity on the immune system, and found that it could reverse approximately 70% of altered core genes. Of note, quercetin reversed numerous pathways, including core pathways such as reduced nuclear receptor activation, sirtuin signaling, Coronavirus pathogenesis pathway, associated acute phase responses and IL-6 signaling. Quercetin also showed impact on the cytoskeleton, favoring a freezing of pathways linked to its mobility in microgravity, by reducing genes associated with Rho GTPase signaling (e.g., reducing RAC, RHOA and CDC42 signaling), and boosting RHOGDI signaling. Despite these changes, quercetin was unable to revert the core immunosuppression pathway of reduced interferon responses. However, since actin skeleton mobility is needed to induce an IFN response in many instances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, too much interference could contribute to a persistent lack of IFN signaling here, and might represent a further mechanism of immune suppression mediated by quercetin that requires more study. Interestingly, after 25&#8201;hours in simulated microgravity, we saw variable results on the induction of senescence pathways, though quercetin markedly reduced senescence associated transcripts in our data. Thus, while quercetin acts in part through its senotherapeutic mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, the large breadth of additional other pathways suggests multiple beneficial modes of activity for immune modulation in microgravity.</p><p id="Par43">Our data support a hypothetical model where microgravity alters forces sensed by immune cells, leading to changes in the actin cytoskeleton, and nuclear receptor signaling, coupled to changes in core pathways in space such as mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress.

Our datasets would support some of these findings. Combined, these pathways would contribute to reduced oxidative phosphorylation and associated basal inflammatory processes, as well as reduced viral sensing pathways, associated reduced interferon responses and altered pyroptosis capability. Reduced interferon responses and signaling, impact both innate cells like monocytes and NK cells, as well as adaptive cells like T cells. Such changes could cumulate in viral or mycobacterial reactivation in microgravity.
