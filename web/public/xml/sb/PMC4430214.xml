Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight is an important step in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS-135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR-2, TLR-4, or TLR-5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment ground controls. Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells, lower percentage of CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHC II<sup>+</sup> cells, and higher percentage of CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHC I<sup>+</sup> populations compared to ground controls. The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD4<sup>+</sup> population but increased CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> cells compared to ground controls. Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD11c<sup>+</sup> population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to ground controls. Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHC I<sup>+</sup>, CD11c<sup>+</sup>MHC II<sup>+</sup>, and CD11c<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> cells compared to ground controls. Production of IFN-&#947; was decreased and IL-2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes. This study demonstrated that expression of surface molecules can be affected by conditions of spaceflight and impaired responsiveness persists under culture conditions <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic>.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><table-count count="4"/><page-count count="19"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are available within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are available within the paper and its Supporting Information file.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the beginning of space travel, there have been reports of reoccurring/opportunistic infections during and post-spaceflight, likely resulting from immune suppression associated with mission parameters. Cosmonauts developed acute respiratory issues after prolonged spaceflight [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and astronauts on Apollo and Skylab missions experienced increased infections [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Published reports documented an increase in reactivation of latent viruses (Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Varicella-Zoster virus) pre-, during, and post-spaceflight compared to healthy ground control individuals [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Multiple factors were cited to alter host immune function of viral control, with stress parameters being the marker of highest correlative value [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Viral reactivation is often accompanied by elevated stress hormones, including cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, shifts in circulating cytokines towards high levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-8 were observed in astronauts found shedding viral particles [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Studies on spaceflight impact on immune function have been investigated through analysis of blood leukocytes obtained from astronauts, cells secured from space flown mice and rats, and <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> cell culture systems [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Several changes in cell populations have been noted immediately post-spaceflight, including decreased total leukocytes, decreased T-cells (specifically CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells), increased monocytes, increased granulocytes, and decreased natural killer cells [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, reports of alterations in circulating leukocytes populations isolated from astronauts post-spaceflight are at best inconsistent; other analyses found no changes in lymphocyte or monocytes populations [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The inconsistency of the data is most likely due to mission specific variables and individual health status.</p><p>The observed changes in immune activity post-spaceflight involves both innate (macrophages and NK cells) and adaptive (T-cell) functions. This report represents the first occasion of a detailed analysis of both surface marker expression and response to stimulation parameters that mimic a broad range of pathogen induced activation events. In order to answer these questions, this study focused on mouse splenocyte composition and function immediately post 13 days of spaceflight, utilizing animals that were part of the historic final flight of NASA&#8217;s Space Shuttle Program (Space Shuttle Atlantis, STS-135). Innate stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLR), the surface receptors that target molecular pathogenic patterns, examined activation events using agonists employed primarily by bacterial or fungal agents. These included zymosan (TLR-2 agonist), lipopolysacchride (LPS; TLR-4 agonist), and flagellin (TLR-5 agonist).The adaptive stimulation parameters included T-cell stimulation using antibodies to stimulate CD3 (T-cell receptor) and CD28 (T-cell co-receptor), or via mitogen, concanvalin A, to bypass the CD28 co-receptor.</p><p>Analysis of mouse splenocytes focused on changes in surface marker expression for T-cells and dendritic cells (DCs), marking a distinction between innate and adaptive immunity. DCs activate upon innate TLR stimulation, leading to increased expression of antigen presentation molecules (MHC I and II) and co-stimulatory molecules (CD86 and 80). Upon cell-cell contact with DCs, CD8<sup>+</sup> (MHC I) or CD4<sup>+</sup> (MHC II) T-cells are activated by antigen recognition through the T-cell receptor (CD3 is the signal transduction region) and the co-stimulatory molecule CD28. The goal of these studies was to determine the influence of spaceflight on immune activity known important for translating innate immune responses to long-lasting T-cell hypersensitive activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Flight Information: Subjects and Spaceflight</title><p>This study was conducted as a subset of a larger parent flight investigation identified as Commercial Biomedical Test Module-3, designed to determine if administering an experimental agent preflight reduces the loss of bone associated with spaceflight [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; multiple investigators shared materials collected post flight [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For the parent study, mice (&#8220;flight mice&#8221;) were flown onboard Space Shuttle Atlantis, mission STS-135, for approximately 13 days. For this immune-specific sub-study, approximately &#189; spleen from six C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, 9 weeks of age at start of flight) were made available immediately following spaceflight. The subjects were flown in a Space Shuttle Animal Enclosure Module (AEM), which was housed in the mid-deck area of the vehicle for the duration of the spaceflight. Spleens from six ground-based control mice, which were handled and housed in a ground-based identical manner (AEM module) to the flight mice were included in the study. The AEM module housing conditions for control mice have been well described [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. AEM ground control mice received vehicle control diluting agent.</p><p>The mice were part of the NASA Ames Research Center&#8217;s Biospecimen Sharing Program (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/cbtm-3-sts-135">http://www.nasa.gov/ames/research/space-biosciences/cbtm-3-sts-135</ext-link>). Flight experiments were designed to investigate effects of microgravity on vascular atrophy in mouse hindlimbs. We are aware that among our six flight mouse subjects, four were treated with a bone-specific medication and two were untreated. For purposes of this article, analysis was conducted on all six flight subjects as a group, without knowledge of treatment, and data were compared to ground AEM control subjects. The individual mice that were drug or placebo treated remained unknown during experimentation; data presented here was not separated according to treatments. To our knowledge, there was no influence of medication on the data collected. Separate analysis of data did not indicate statistical outliers within the combined spaceflight mice, which would indicate affects due to treatment. In light of this, we believe our findings are relevant and important, even in light of inclusion of mice that received the bone loss experimental drug.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Mouse Splenocytes Processing</title><p>Animals were retrieved approximately 1 hour following deorbit, and sacrificed within 3&#8211;5 hours post flight, collected on July 21, 2011 at Kennedy Space Center (Cape Canaveral, FL).

This disruption in immune activity is believed to be partly responsible for observed spaceflight and post-flight related incidence of immune-related adverse health events that may occur during spaceflight. With future plans for longer duration space travel, the question of how changes in host immunity would affect overall crew health needs to be addressed. The experiments conducted in this report focused on changes that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses. This bridge is crucial to generating long-term memory protection against infection, and critical for mounting immune responses during reinfection and reactivation post flight. Specifically, this report investigated the ability of dendritic cells (DC) to respond to stimulation through TLRs, and T-cell responsiveness through the T-cell receptor.</p><p>To determine baseline receptor expression, the splenocytes were stained upon landing. These native expressions found no differences observed in the percent population changes of CD4 or CD8 T cells, with results reflecting similar findings from published works showing no changes in percent population of CD4 or CD8 T cells in rodents post-spaceflight [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Other reports show mixed changes. Specifically, some have identified increases in CD4 and CD8 populations [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], others show decreased CD4 and CD8 populations [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and others have shown a combination thereof [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] post-flight. Pecaut, et al. demonstrated that there was indeed a shift in leukocyte phenotypes to different organs, which may affect localization of response [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Likewise, conflicting reports are found from peripheral blood of astronauts post-flight [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Some of these differences were attributed to the type of lymph organ examined, as thymus cells usually shows no change in CD4 and CD8 T cells populations while splenocytes do exhibit differences between flight animals and ground controls [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The seemingly contradictory evidence could be explained by different gating strategies used to determine percent positivity of events. The study presented here showed that splenocytes from mice post-flight demonstrated an increase in a cell population with high percentages of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><p>While previous reports only examined percent positive populations, this study included examination of marker intensity, which was interpreted to indicate an increase in marker expression per cell. There was a significant decrease in the intensity of CD4 and an increase in intensity of CD8 expression on a per cell basis. Since CD4 and CD8 molecules play a role during T-cell recognition of antigen presentation by binding to the antigen presentation molecules, MHC I, MHC II, or CD1, any change in their surface expression could affect the avidity potential to alter T-cell stimulation. Indeed, the avidity/affinity model of peripheral T-cell regulation suggests that changes in CD4 and CD8 expression affect T-cell activation. CD8<sup>lo</sup> cells require higher avidity of T-cell receptor and MHC I interactions for activation [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and control/suppress other CD8 T-cell responsiveness to antigen [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>This study also found splenocytes from flight mice had a significant decrease in intensity of CD25 expression on CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells compared to ground controls. CD25 is the IL-2 receptor, which is often used as a marker to denote regulatory T-cells. However, this decrease in CD25 intensity is not interpreted to indicate a change in regulatory T-cell post-flight, especially because the population of CD25<sup>+</sup> splenocytes did not change. The CD25 ligand, IL-2, is the T-cell proliferating factor. Experiments on the Jurkat T cell line post-flight demonstrated a lack of proliferation and elevations of Fas/APO-1, suggesting spaceflight conditions induced apoptosis in T-cells [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The decrease in CD25 expression on a per cell basis suggests that flight splenocytes downregulate factors for proliferation. And it has been clearly demonstrated that immediate early genes of lymphocytes are affected under conditions of microgravity [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>Dendritic cells are the primary antigen presenting cells to bridge innate and adaptive immunity. DCs respond to invading pathogens, prime and activate antigen specific T-cells, and promote development of antigen specific memory. In the mouse, expression of CD11c, a &#946;2 integrin, is a marker for DC identification. Splenocytes from flight mice demonstrated a significant increase in CD11c<sup>+</sup> population compared to ground controls, suggesting an enhancement of the DC population. This is the first reported change of spaceflight on DC population dynamics. Interestingly, previous published reports examining another &#946;2 integrin, CD11b, showed a decrease population change, interpreted as a decrease in monocytes/macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which was also observed using CD14/16 markers for identification [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As with T-cells, spaceflight conditions were also reported to increased monocyte/macrophage population [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Similar to T-cell subsets, macrophages and dendritic cells populations have differential proliferation results in response to spaceflight.</p><p>Examination of MHC I and II presentation molecule expression found that CD11c<sup>+</sup> splenocytes post-flight had a significant increase in MHC I<sup>+</sup> and a significant decrease in MHC II<sup>+</sup> populations compared to ground controls. There are limited reports on antigen presentation molecule expression, and both published articles also found a decrease in class II presentation molecules expressing populations [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. These results confirm that spaceflight alters class II presentation molecule expression, which may indicate a diminution in the potential to effectively present antigens to CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells.</p><p>Splenocytes post-spaceflight demonstrated an increase in bead uptake compared to ground controls. This is the first report that flight conditions influence particle uptake. The implications suggest that spaceflight does not hinder particle uptake, and may even enhance the function. However, it is not clear how alteration of particulate uptake would affect host immune status. Limited hindlimb suspension model studies may shed light on this, if one takes the assumption that uptake of pathogenic organisms are similar to that of beads. In those studies, <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> infection found no change in clearance of rotavirus [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and a decrease in bacterial clearance of <italic toggle="yes">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and <italic toggle="yes">Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. This suggests that other immune effects resulting from spaceflight contribute to clearance dysfunction, even if there are increased uptake events of particulates. Overall, this is difficult to assess, and we realize that beads travel along different phagocytic pathways than the agents mentioned.</p><p>Development of effective immunity towards pathogens relies on responding to innate signals. The toll-like receptors (TLR) are well established pattern recognition receptors stimulated by pathogenic motifs [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The most commonly used TLR ligand to investigate spaceflight effect on cell function is lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In humans, blood cells isolated during spaceflight responded to LPS by increasing production of IL-8, however, this finding resolved upon post-spaceflight examination [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. LPS has also shown to promote lower production of IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and IL-10 and increased IL-1&#946; post-spaceflight in humans [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Reports in mice show a mixed response when looking a whole splenocyte populations [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Purified macrophages flow in space demonstrated an increase in both IL-1 and TNF-&#945; production in response to LPS [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. While that report did not observe a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines upon LPS stimulation, the flight splenocytes did exhibit a trend of increase in TNF-&#945; and IL-6 production compared to ground controls. The data presented here extended observations to include cytokine production with the TLR-2/6 and TLR-5 ligands, zymosan (fungal) and flagellin (bacterial) respectively. Zymosan stimulated a significant increase in TNF-&#945;; no cytokine changes were observed upon flagellin stimulation. Chapes et al. investigated stimulation with poly I:C, a TLR-3 ligand, and found an increase in IFN-&#945; [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For the most part, flight exposure did not have a deleterious effect on TLR activation and stimulation, suggesting that the innate immune inflammatory response remains intact.</p><p>Few published articles have examined changes in surface expression of presentation and co-stimulatory molecules after TLR stimulation. While cytokine production is an important indicator of immune response, the main effect of how DCs response to TLR stimulation is to increase antigen presentation and stimulate T-cells [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Splenocytes demonstrated similar changes DC surface molecule expression post flight, regardless of TLR stimulation. For example, the DC population from the flight mice had altered MHC I and MHC II expressing populations compared to ground controls, even in cultures that did not receive TLR-agonist stimulation.</p><p>Regarding adaptive immune functions, T-cells are critical for control of re-infection and re-activation events. Unlike DCs, the effect post-spaceflight on T-cell activity has been well documented. Stimulating with anti-CD3/CD28, which simulates T-cell activation by antigen presenting cells, resulted in increased IFN-&#947; and decreased IL-2 [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. ConA stimulation, which stimulates T-cells through the T-cell receptor without requiring the secondary signal (CD28), resulted in no change or increased IL-2 [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], increased IL-3, and decreased IFN-&#947; [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Use of other mitogens, such as PHA or PMA/Ionomycin, that stimulates by bypassing both the T-cell and co-stimulatory receptors, led to no change or decreased IL-2 [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], decreased IFN-&#947; [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and decreased TNF-&#945; [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The data in this report reflects some differences in reported observations, although in line with that reported by Gridley, et al. [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Rather, the results reported here for ConA stimulation demonstrated a non-significant increase in IFN-&#947; and decreased IL-2. The discrepancy in cytokine results could be differences in cell culture number, concentration of stimulants, and time of stimulation.</p><p>Surface molecule expression was examined in stimulated T-cells. Little or no differences were observed in the flight mice versus ground controls, with two notable exceptions. Regardless of stimulation parameters, the cultured splenocytes isolated from flight mice were significantly depressed in their expression of CD4. Second, while expression of CD8 intensity immediately post-spaceflight demonstrated an increase on a per cell basis, further <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> culture of cells distinctively identified two sets of CD8 cells, CD8<sup>lo</sup> and CD8<sup>hi</sup>. This distinction disappeared upon ConA stimulation. Indeed, the flight mice splenocytes evidenced a significant increase in CD4 or CD8 T-cells that also expressed CD25 or CD25/28. Therefore, it is important for future studies to define gating strategies, as we have done here. We suggest that CD25, along with CD69, are used as markers of early T-cell activation. Short-term spaceflight increased expression of CD25/69 when stimulated with anti-CD3/28 [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The results with ConA may indicate that flight mice could demonstrate increased early T-cell activation upon stimulation, compared to ground controls.</p><p>Our report focused on phenotypic alterations that bridge innate and adaptive immune responses crucial for generating protective immune responses during reinfection and reactivation post flight. It would indeed be important to understand how long the phenotypic changes were sustained post flight; analysis of genetic alterations or changes in methylation status would certainly be warranted. The condition of the spaceflight environment has been shown to alter cytosine methylation patterns to generate heritable epigenetic changes in rice. Both hypo- and hypermethylation events can occur, with concurrent dysregulation of gene expression. Genes for DNA methyltransferases were very sensitive to spaceflight conditions [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Similar effects were identified in microgravity studies in human lymphocytes [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], where both DNA methylation genes, as well as histone acetylation genes, were affected. In addition, DNA repair mechanisms were also diminished. Overall this suggests both an accumulation of damaged DNA as well as the potential for inheritable and sustainable changes in cellular phenotypic activity.</p><p>In conclusion, there exists a large body of evidence that spaceflight does impact T-cell activity and cause global suppression in response to multiple stimulants. Indeed, these &#8220;type IV hypersensitive&#8221; class responses have been found to be reduced to a variety of antigens during and post spaceflight [<xref rid="pone.0124380.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0124380.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. The data from this study shed additional light towards molecular mechanisms involved in immune changes induced by spaceflight that could alter activation of innate and adaptive immunity, at least post flight. It remains to be determined if these changes may also impact responses during active flight. Given the limited number of subjects for spaceflight studies, future analysis should continue to examine both innate (DC) and adaptive (T-cell) responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0124380.s001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>(PPTX)</p></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="pone.0124380.s001.pptx" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to express their appreciation to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Amgen for making the study tissues available to the scientific community.
