For instance, 14-3-3 proteins influence the photosensory system through interactions with Constans (CO) protein. 14-3-3 associations with the photosensory system were further studied in this investigation using 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants to study root and chloroplast development. The 14-3-3 &#956; T-DNA insertion mutant, <italic>14-3-3&#956;-1</italic>, had shorter roots than the wild type and the difference in root length could be influenced by light intensity. The 14-3-3 &#957; T-DNA insertion mutants also had shorter roots, but only when grown under narrow-bandwidth red light. Five-day-old 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion and <italic>co</italic> mutants all had increased root greening compared with the wild type, which was influenced by light wavelength and intensity. However, beyond 10 d of growth, <italic>14-3-3&#956;-1</italic> roots did not increase in greening as much as wild-type roots.

In plants, 14-3-3 protein binding activity includes the regulation of key metabolic enzymes, such as nitrate reductase and sucrose synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bachmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Toroser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>), and also the activation of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olsson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuglsang <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Svennelid <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ottmann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Throughout eukaryotes, 14-3-3 proteins are known to bind a multitude of different proteins and, specifically, participate in a wide array of signal transduction regulatory events.</p><p>Multicellular eukaryotes contain multiple 14-3-3 protein family members, or isoforms. The number of 14-3-3 isoforms can vary per organism, but <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contains 13 expressed 14-3-3 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rosenquist <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sehnke <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The 14-3-3 proteins throughout eukaryotes share sequence homology within the core region of the protein sequence, but sequences of individual isoforms diverge in the amino- and carboxy-terminal tails. The importance of multiple 14-3-3 isoforms per organism remains to be elucidated, however, reverse genetic studies analysing knockout or knock down mutants continue to identify specific roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Su <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sugiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Purwestri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants were utilized to find association of the 14-3-3 isoforms &#956; and &#965; with both light sensing during early development and time of transition to flowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Red light-grown 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants exhibit decreased hypocotyl elongation inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>) reminiscent of, but not identical to Phytochrome B (PHYB) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koornneef <italic>et al.</italic>, 1980</xref>). The 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants also flower later in long-day conditions (16 h of light), but not in short-day conditions (8 h of light) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). In rice, the opposite phenotype occurs when manipulating expression of the 14-3-3 isoform, GF14c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Purwestri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). Over-expression of GF14c results in delayed flowering, while knockout results in early flowering. These 14-3-3 mutant phenotypes indicate a role in light-related signalling for these particular 14-3-3 isoforms. The relationship of 14-3-3 proteins with light signalling is further supported by the observation that 14-3-3 proteins bind the blue light photoreceptor Phototropin 1 (PHOT1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kinoshita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) and the flowering timing regulation protein Constans (CO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>), as well as downstream targets such as Flowering Timing (FT) and Self-Pruning (SP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pnueli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Light perception is broadly important for phototropic responses, time of flowering, and root development. For example, Red and far-red light influence the directional growth of roots. Roots of some plants, such as maize and rice, grow horizontally in the dark, but grow downward when the plants are irradiated with red or far-red light from above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Takano <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>). In addition, there is copious expression of photoreceptors in the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pratt and Coleman, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Somers and Quail, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Toth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), suggesting a functional relevance for photoreceptors in root development. Root hair development is enhanced by light and mediated by phytochromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Simone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000<italic>a</italic></xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9"><italic>b</italic></xref>). Further, both Phytochrome A (PHYA) and PHYB regulate red-light-induced root hair development while far-red-induced root hair development is regulated by PHYA alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Simone <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000<italic>a</italic></xref>).</p><p>Photoreceptors also control chloroplast development in roots that are exposed to light. Prolonged exposure of plant roots to light stimulates the development of chloroplasts in the roots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Whatley, 1983</xref>). Chloroplast development in the roots is stimulated by red and blue light, with cryptochrome 1 and 2 (CRY1 and CRY2) as the primary regulators of blue light-stimulated chloroplast development and PHYB as the primary regulator in red light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Usami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>This study utilizes the previously described T-DNA insertion mutants of 14-3-3 &#956; and &#965; to examine the roles of individual 14-3-3 isoforms in root elongation and chloroplast development, that are controlled by the photosensory system.

A left border T-DNA specific primer (LBb1) and two, T-DNA flanking, PHYB gene-specific primers were used to identify lines that were homozygous for T-DNA insertion into the respective 14-3-3 genes.

Differences seen in both root length and greening under blue light will be evaluated in future studies, especially in the potential for 14-3-3 association with CRY1 and its role in root length and greening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Usami <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canamero <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The increased chloroplast numbers in the roots of the 14-3-3 T-DNA insertion mutants and <italic>co</italic> indicated that 14-3-3 proteins and CO are negative regulators of chloroplast development in the roots. No quantifiable difference in root greening was detected in the roots of any of the lines grown under red light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6D</xref>), although <italic>14-3-3&#956;-1</italic> and <italic>co</italic> were the only lines to develop high enough numbers of chloroplasts to be visualized with a fluorescent microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6C</xref>). Additional work is necessary to further characterize 14-3-3 &#956; or CO as co-regulators of chloroplast development in the roots via red-light signalling. In fact, this is the first report implicating CO with root development, however, CONSTANS-LIKE3 (COL3) is associated with root development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Datta <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although PHYB has not been identified as a protein binding partner of 14-3-3 proteins, phytochromes are regulated by phosphorylation, and the association of PHYB with several phosphorylation events presents many situations of possible 14-3-3 protein involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In addition, PHYB and PHYA induce phosphorylation of such proteins as PKS1 and PIF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fankhauser <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Sady <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>This study presents novel roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast development, as well as new roles of CO in chloroplast development. Transcription levels of CO are increased in early development upon irradiance of 4-d-old dark-grown seedlings with a far-red light treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tepperman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>), but a function for CO in early development has not been defined. In fact, the increase in chloroplast development in roots is the first reported phenotype for <italic>co</italic> in early development. The activity of CO in chloroplast development may only be as a component of the activity of CO and the COL proteins.</p><p>The present reverse-genetic study establishes novel, isoform-specific roles of 14-3-3 proteins in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root and chloroplast development. 14-3-3 proteins are increasingly recognized as a major node in the plant interactome, an interaction node that includes CO and other signalling molecules related to light responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">AIMC, 2011</xref>). Further, the roles of 14-3-3 proteins in root and chloroplast development are controlled by light intensity or wavelength. 14-3-3 TDNA insertion mutants also exhibit reduced hypocotyl elongation and time to flowering, compared with the wild type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Both the hypocotyl elongation and flowering timing phenotypes are, in part, due to 14-3-3 binding/influence of CO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mayfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). The study presented here also characterizes CO as a potential factor in root chloroplast development of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> during early development. Further work will be necessary to understand the mechanism of 14-3-3 control of both root and chloroplast development and how the association of 14-3-3 proteins and CO factors into these processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ers022/-/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> can be found at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jxb.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jxb/ers022/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link><bold>.</bold> Overactivity of nitrate reductase can not be attributed to the shorter root lengths of <italic>14-3-3&#956;&#956;-1</italic>.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Supplementary Data</title></caption><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_63_8_3061__index.html" position="float" orientation="portrait"/><media xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_ers022_00073718-file001.pdf" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Drs Kevin Folta and Amit Dhingra for their time and intellectual input.
