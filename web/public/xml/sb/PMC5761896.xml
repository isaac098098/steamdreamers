Antibodies are heterodimers of heavy- and light-chains encoded on separate loci. We studied the antibody repertoire from pooled, splenic tissue of unimmunized, adult female C57BL/6J mice, using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) without amplification of antibody transcripts. We recovered over 90,000 heavy-chain and over 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences. Individual V-, D-, and J-gene segment usage was uniform among the three mouse pools, particularly in highly abundant gene segments, with low frequency V-gene segments not being detected in all pools. Despite the similar usage of individual gene segments, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences in each mouse pool was highly varied, affirming the combinatorial diversity in the B-cell pool that has been previously demonstrated. There also was some skewing in the V-gene segments that were detected depending on chromosomal location. This study presents a unique, non-primer biased glimpse of the conventionally housed, unimmunized antibody repertoire of the C57BL6/J mouse.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNX13AN34G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Pecaut</surname><given-names>Michael J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000104</institution-id><institution>National Aeronautics and Space Administration</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNX15AB45G</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Chapes</surname><given-names>Stephen K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name name-style="western"><surname>Chapes</surname><given-names>Stephen K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution>Kansas State University College of Veterinary Medicine</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Kansas State University (US)</institution></funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by NNX13AN34G and NNX15AB45G from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nasa.gov/">https://www.nasa.gov/</ext-link>) (SKC and MJP); GM103418 from the National Institute of Health (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nih.gov/">https://www.nih.gov/</ext-link>) (SKC); College of Veterinary Medicine at Kansas State University (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vet.k-state.edu/">http://www.vet.k-state.edu/</ext-link>); and Kansas State University Johnson Cancer - Research Center (<ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.k-state.edu/">http://cancer.k-state.edu/</ext-link>).

Antibodies consist of heterodimers of heavy and light chains [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The heavy chain is formed from V-, D-, and J-gene segments combined with a constant region [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], while light chains lack a D-gene segment.

Of the CDRs, CDR3 contributes the most to binding specificity. Antibodies are further characterized by the constant region, or isotype, which is influenced by the stage of B-cell development and antigen specificity [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The total collection of antibody specificities present within an individual is known as the antibody repertoire. Diversity of the antibody repertoire results from four main components: the initial germ line (inherited), diversity from recombination of that germline, the imprecisions during V(D)J recombination, and somatic mutations [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

More specifically, our lab is interested antibody repertoire dynamics within the context of spaceflight. Due to the cost of these experiments, creating datasets that can be mined by our lab or others is important. The antibody repertoire is traditionally assessed through the amplification of Ig sequences that have been isolated from sorted B cell populations [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. While these practices increase the likelihood of recovering rare Ig sequences and allow for the dissection of the antibody repertoire by B-cell populations, cell sorting may not be possible within the design of certain experiments. During the development of methodology to assess Ig-gene usage by mice subjected to space flight we performed multiple HTS runs to validate sample preparation, bioinformatic methodology, and reproducibility [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. We also wanted some background data about the Ig repertoire in the normal B6 mouse population. Knowing that there can be significant mouse-to-mouse variability in the Ig repertoire [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and to minimize the impact any one mouse might have in the validation data set, we chose to pool multiple mice specifically for these validation experiments [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Briefly, spleens were collected from three independent pools of four, specific pathogen-free (based on the RADIL Advantage Basic profile), female, C57BL/6J mice nine-to-eleven weeks old. Animals were euthanized with isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. Briefly, mice were exposed to 400&#956;L isoflurane in a gauze-pad enclosed in a histopathology cassette in a 450 mL chamber as was described by Huerkamp <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Animals used in pool one were raised in the Laboratory Animal Care Services (LACS) facility (breeder stock renewed less than 2 years previous) in the Division of Biology at Kansas State University. Mice from pools two and three were received directly from Jackson Laboratories and were house in the LACS facility. Mice were fed LabDiet 5001 and had access to water and food <italic toggle="yes">ad libitum</italic>. Mice were maintained on a 12/12 light/dark cycle. Mice for pools two and three were allowed to acclimate in the vivarium for 22&#8211;31 days prior to sacrifice. Animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Kansas State University. After euthanasia, spleen tissue was processed immediately for RNA extraction with Trizol LS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Pool one contained RNA from one-half of the spleen tissue while pools two and three contained RNA extracted from complete spleens. Equal concentrations of total splenic RNA (RIN&gt;8) were pooled and mixed from each of the four mice, resulting in three final pools. At least one microgram of RNA from each pool was submitted for size selection (275&#8211;800 nucleotides) and sequencing on Illumina MiSeq at 2x300 nucleotides as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Sequencing was performed at the Kansas State University Integrated Genomics Facility using the standard Illuimna sequencing protocol, including oligo-dT-bead selection of mRNA and reverse transcription to cDNA. A reduced fragmentation time (one minute) was used to yield longer transcripts [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To avoid potential primer bias and maintain a dataset that could be further mined, we did not amplify Ig sequences. The authors note that a subset of mouse pool one data was used in a methods paper presented by our group.

Both paired and merged (overlapping pairs) were mapped to V-gene segments and the loci using a match score of +1 and a mismatch score of -2 to identify potential antibody sequences. The sequences were collected and submitted to ImMunoGenTics&#8217;s (IMGT) High-V Quest for identification [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Due to the chances of collecting the same read multiple times through the mapping and identification process, only one sequence per sequence ID was analyzed (procedure outlined in Rettig <italic toggle="yes">et</italic> al [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]). Productive and unknown functionality sequences were identified via IMGT and used for subsequent analyses. Productive antibody sequences were defined as in frame and did not contain a stop codon. However, binding abilities were not assessed. Unknown sequences did not contain enough sequencing information to determine functionality. Gene segments were identified using IMGT&#8217;s nomenclature and using IMGT&#8217;s list of gene segments, including functional and open reading frame-defined gene segments. We implemented two procedural changes to further define the repertoire that are different from the methodology presented in Rettig <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this current manuscript, when calculating the percent abundance in the repertoire, we also include V-gene segments where one or two possible V-gene segments were detected. When one single V-gene segment was detected in a sequence, it was assigned a value of one. When two potential V-gene segments were detected each gene segment was assigned a value of 0.5. The totals were then tabulated as described in Rettig <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Additionally, CDR3 sequences that did not fit the C-xx-W motif for IgH (heavy-chain) were reclassified as unknown functionality, unless a class-switched isotype (IgA, IgD, IgE) was detected. CDR3 sequences for Ig&#954; (kappa-chain) that did not fit the C-xx-F motif were classified as unknown functionality. Sequencing reads containing hyperlengthy (greater than 2x the average, or 18 amino acids (AAs)) &#954;-CDR3 that fit the C-xx-F motif were also removed from analysis as we believed they were falsely identified through bioinformatic or sequencing errors.</p><p>Initial nucleotide alignments were created with MAFFT [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] using portions of the germline and CDR3 nucleotide sequences provided by IMGT.

For both IgH and Ig&#954;, J- and D-gene segments designated as undetermined (U) were either not reported by IMGT, contained less than six nucleotides, or multiple gene segments were assigned to a single sequencing read.

All productive VH- and V&#954;-gene segments and open reading frames listed on IMGT for the B6 mouse were analyzed and gene segments not found in our datasets were assigned a read count of zero. The IMGT productive list includes all gene segments detected in the NCBI annotation of the mouse genome. The IMGT chromosomal locations were also used for any chromosomal analysis, though not all gene segments have a defined chromosomal location. Gene segments that were not defined by location in IMGT were excluded from any chromosomal analysis. These analyses were performed on each mouse pool separately by comparing the observed raw-read count values of V-gene segments to an expected theoretical number of reads which was based on the null hypothesis that all V-gene segments will have the same number of raw reads. This value was determined by dividing the total number of antibody reads observed in a mouse pool by the number of possible gene segments. The analysis of gene-segment usage by chromosomal location was performed by dividing gene segments into four quadrants based on nucleotide position. A quadrant was defined as one-fourth of the entire locus, as determined by number of nucleotides in the locus. Gene segment location was defined as the first nucleotide of the gene segment. A Chi-square analysis was performed on each mouse pool by summing the raw-read counts of all gene segments containing a 5&#8217; nucleotide position within each quadrant and comparing the observed total reads within a quadrant to an expected theoretical number of reads for each quadrant which was based on the null hypothesis that the number of raw reads is not statistically different between defined quadrants.</p><p>Percent of repertoire values were determined by dividing sequencing reads corresponding to each gene segment, constant region, or CDR3 length by the total number of gene segments, constant regions, or CDR identified in each mouse pool for normalized comparison between pools.

Although the three groups were encoded by the same V-, D-, and J-gene segments, gene segment representation across each sample was variable. Most variability occurred in or around the D-gene segment, which could be due to splicing, N- and P-nucleotide additions, and deletions during somatic recombination. D-gene usage also appeared to be a factor determining CDR3 length. This was evidenced by increasing D-gene representation across CDR3 selections of decreasing length compared to the relative conservation of the V- and J-gene segments, though J-gene conservation seemed to decrease among extremely short CDR3s. Overall, the V-gene segment appeared to remain the most uniform.</p><p>While Ig&#954; contains mostly CDR3 sequences that are nine amino acids in length, many highly abundant VJ-gene segment combinations (such as V110 and J2) contained CDR3s of multiple lengths.

Others have looked at Ig-gene segment usage with other strategies [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] but we wanted to determine if a straight-forward RNA-Seq approach would provide us with a reasonable assessment of B cell Ig-segment use without the limitations that amplification methods introduce (Rettig <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., In Revision).</p><p>To minimize potential single animal aberrations and repertoire skewing, we pooled splenic tissue of four unimmunized mice in three biological replicates. This approach was successful since we saw less variation with pooled samples compared to data sets that are made up of single mice [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Grieff <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. demonstrated that CDR3 and VDJ composition in pooled mouse samples were less polarized than that of an individually sequenced mouse subjected to antigen challenge [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Therefore, our data are consistent with that study. We also did the technical replication of material in pool one and found that there was good reproducibility (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.7562) [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, the data in the individual normal mouse pools and a compiled summary of those data are a strong reflection of the normal mouse repertoire.</p><p>The most common VH-gene segment was V1-80, which was the most common in pools one and two. V6-3 was the most common in pool three. In selecting the ten most common VH-gene segments from each pool, we identified 14 different VH-gene segments, with heavy overlap among pools. All VH-gene segments isolated comprised between 1% to 8% of the repertoire. This VH V-gene variation is consistent with previous observations [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] but the pools ameliorated the extreme variations that was reported by that group. We also saw that V&#954;-gene segment usage was comparable among mouse pools, with 17 gene segments comprising between 1% and 13% of the repertoire. Although we have found that gene segment use among all three pooled sample groups was similar, there were some differences. V5-39 was observed at a high frequency in pool one (10%) as compared to pools two (1%) and three (3%). This skewing could be the result of a mouse within pool one responding to a specific antigen that other mice did not respond to or more likely, represents the natural variability of mice [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, even pooling samples maintains the randomness of antibody gene selection and rearrangement and a pool of four individuals still has relative uniqueness.</p><p>Some have suggested that V-gene segment usage may be skewed [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Chi-square analyses of VH- and V&#954;-gene segment use in our data set would support this contention since several VH and V&#954;-gene segments were used more frequently than expected. Even though we have analyzed three independent biological samples made of pools of four mice, we recognize that an even larger data set will be needed to conclusively settle this discussion. Studies on humans have revealed similar V(D)J usage in spite of them being outbred populations [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] which also supports that there is some inherent selection in V-gene selection regardless of genetics. Additional studies looking at epigenetic changes or other transcriptional regulatory elements such as the characterization performed by Choi et al. [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] might also help understand mechanisms of V-gene segment selection.</p><p>For the D-gene segment, three usage levels were detected. D1-1 was the most used gene segment in all three pools; comprising around 26% of the total repertoire. Over 36% of D-gene segments could not be identified, likely due to the short length of the D-gene segment. Nevertheless, we do see different populations of antibodies even when they do share similar D-genes segments. Some have large D-gene segments where others have little recognizable sequence.</p><p>JH-gene segment usage was relatively uniform. J2 was the most common among all three pools, with over 32% use in the repertoire. J1, J3, and J4 were evenly represented among all three pools totaling between 19&#8211;27% of the repertoire. Gene segments with less than six nucleotides were unable to be identified and occur at less than 0.1% of the heavy-chain repertoire. J&#954;-gene segment usage is somewhat evenly distributed among J1, J2, and J5 comprising between 25&#8211;32% of the repertoire, in agreement with the findings of Aoki-ota <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], Lu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. found a slightly different J&#954; expression profile, possibly reflecting strain specific usage of J&#954; [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. As paralleled in the heavy-chain data, gene segments with less than six nucleotides were rare; occurring in less than 0.4% of the total repertoire.</p><p>Constant region usage in the heavy-chain was heavily dominated by IgM, which reflects the &#8220;na&#239;ve&#8221; status of our mice. Although IgM comprised over 78% of the total identified constant regions we did see the expression of IgG, IgA and IgD. IgE was rare, being detected in only pool three. However, when compared to serum data, even in na&#239;ve mice, there was a high level of circulating IgGs, which was not reflected in spleen tissue sequencing, which instead shows very high levels of IgM [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. This could be due to a large B-cell population in the spleen that is not secreting antibody at high levels into the bloodstream [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>We looked at the common H-CDR3 sequences among the three mouse pools. There was little overlap; with only 75 H-CDR3s detected in all three pools and between 92 and 163 common H-CDR3s when we just looked at two pools. We detected between 4.6k to 6.2k unique sequences found only in each respective pool. While we sampled a small fraction of CDR3s present in the total antibody repertoire, Lu <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. and Greiff <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. used primer amplification to enrich for IgH transcripts and still found high CDR3 variability among individuals [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].Similarly, in a study comparing monozygotic twins, Glanville <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., also demonstrated that CDR3 profiles between the individuals were quite diverse despite similar gene family usage between the twins [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Therefore, the pooling methodology that we employed did not significantly diminish the detection of the unique CDR3 repertoires that individuals have.</p><p>When we examined the &#954;-CDR3 usage among the three biological samples, there was a higher proportion of common &#954;-CDR3s. Unique &#954;-CDR3s within each pool ranged from 688 to 832 CDR3 identified within all three pools and between 108 and 178 CDR3 identified in only two pools. One explanation for light-chain CDR3 length homogeneity may be selection due to light-chain editing that occurs during B-cell maturation and the need to be able to interchange the light chains.</p><p>The small numbers of overlapping CDR3 sequences among our three pooled samples suggests that significant variation in the idiotypes could develop, even within an inbred population of mice and reinforces the idea of unique generation of B-cell diversity in inbred and outbred populations [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Moreover, we were curious if the size of the total pool of B cells could be estimated from our data. Using a model of capture-recapture methodology [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], the Chapman estimator, [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and the number of common heavy-chain CDR3 sequences seen in each of our samplings, we estimated our B-cell pool to range from 1.5&#8211;14 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells. If we assume that there are 5 x 10<sup>6</sup> B cells in a nine to eleven-week-old female C57BL/6J mouse spleen, and our mouse pools were made up of four spleens, this estimate of the possible splenic B-cell pool is reasonably accurate, especially if we take into account some of the CDR3 sequences were detected multiple times (multiple B cells with the same IgH).</p><p>While CDR3 is commonly used to describe the antibody repertoire, many studies have reported the combinations of the V(D)J [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Compiling CDR3 nucleotide alignments allowed us to visualize the significance of individual gene segment involvement with the CDR3 in the context of specific V(D)J combinations. Sequencing outside of CDR3 also can reveal biologically relevant information about antigen binding and allows for further characterization of B-cell ontogeny. Our approach allowed us to identify V(D)J-gene segments in addition to the constant region and provided insight into the pairing of V-gene segments with (D)J-gene segments.</p><p>The information about the unchallenged Ig-gene repertoire also has other uses. It provides a comparative foundation when looking at host response to antigen [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and has been used to isolated therapeutic antibodies. Antibodies for influenza in a mouse model and were a valuable tool in the detection of antigen specific responses [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>While a lack of amplification may extricate primer bias, we knew that it would come at the cost of potentially excluding rare B-cell clones. In humans, for example, a single clone may only comprise 0.1% to 0.3% of the repertoire [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. We have explored the differences between samples that have and have not been amplified and found a moderate correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.5815, 0.5855, p&lt;0.0001, Rettig <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., In Revision). While some of the differences arose from expected depth-of-sequencing issues, we unexpectedly found that discrepancies also resulted from gene segments being detected in the unamplified data set not detected in the amplified data sets (Rettig <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>., In Revision). It is also important to note that the number of immunoglobulin reads detected in our RNASeq library equaled or exceeded those in other HTS studies [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Therefore, we are aware of the tradeoffs and benefits of the HTS strategy we have used.</p><p>Another issue which may affect the data presented stems from the use of whole spleen tissue rather than isolated B-cell populations [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Although our approach was necessary to accommodate requirements of a separate investigation [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], we are aware that the inclusion of extraneous cells as result of using whole tissue could reduce the recovery of rare B-cell clones. In addition, some bias might be introduced because of cell subpopulation stability and frequency in whole spleen tissue [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Nevertheless, in spite of the limitations of our methodology, it appears that the repertoire we detected correlated with mouse studies that have used selection and amplification methods of various kinds. For example, Collins <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. detected five of the same VH genes that we detected among our highest 10 used VH-gene segments. JH2 was also the most frequently detected in both of our studies [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Yang and Kaplinski detected V-gene segment use that paralleled our findings with V1-26 identified by them as the most frequently used [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Few studies have explored the light chain repertoire; however, more characterization will be possible with increasing use of single cell amplification [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. While strain specificity has been reported [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190982.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], many V&#954;-gene segments that were represented over one-percent of the time in unimmunized BALB/c mice were also identified in our study [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Aoki-Ota <italic toggle="yes">et al</italic>. also noted V&#954;-gene segment skewing in their assessment of unimmunized C57BL/6 mice [<xref rid="pone.0190982.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. These similarities also suggest that the lack of amplification did not dramatically affect our assessment of the B-cell repertoire, and the differences seen are likely due to mouse-to-mouse variation that still manifests in our pooled samples.</p><p>In conclusion, we have presented an unamplified view of the conventionally housed, unimmunized, antibody repertoire. It appears that an RNASeq approach without amplification can provide an accurate assessment of V-gene use as well as a snapshot of the CDR3 present in the population; and helps validate this as a reasonable scientific approach. In addition, we lay the foundation for future work in our lab to characterize the unamplified whole tissue repertoire of the immunized C57BL/6 mouse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190982.s001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>V gene segment rankings among the three mouse pools for both IgH (A) and Ig&#954; (B).</bold> The most abundant gene segment is ranked as one.
