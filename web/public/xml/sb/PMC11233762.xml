<bold>Introduction:</bold> Space is a unique environment characterized by isolation from community life and exposure to circadian misalignment, microgravity, and space radiation. These multiple differences from those experienced on the earth may cause systemic and local tissue stress. Autonomic nerves, including sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, regulate functions in multiple organs. Saliva is secreted from the salivary gland, which is regulated by autonomic nerves, and plays several important roles in the oral cavity and digestive processes. The balance of the autonomic nervous system in the seromucous glands, such as the submandibular glands, precisely controls serous and mucous saliva. Psychological stress, radiation damage, and other triggers can cause an imbalance in salivary secretion systems. A previous study reported that amylase is a stress marker in behavioral medicine and space flight crews; however, the detailed mechanisms underlying amylase regulation in the space environment are still unknown.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, we aimed to elucidate how lunar gravity (1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) changes mRNA expression patterns in the salivary gland. Using a multiple artificial gravity research system during space flight in the International Space Station, we studied the effects of two different gravitational levels, lunar and Earth gravity, on the submandibular glands of mice. All mice survived, returned to Earth from space, and their submandibular glands were collected 2&#160;days after landing.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> We found that lunar gravity induced the expression of the salivary amylase gene <italic toggle="yes">Amy1</italic>; however, no increase in <italic toggle="yes">Aqp5</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Ano1</italic>, which regulate water secretion, was observed. In addition, genes involved in the exocrine system, such as vesicle-associated membrane protein 8 (<italic toggle="yes">Vamp8</italic>) and small G proteins, including <italic toggle="yes">Rap1</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Rab</italic> families, were upregulated under lunar gravity.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results imply that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via <italic toggle="yes">Rap</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Rab</italic> signaling and exocytosis via <italic toggle="yes">Vamp8</italic>. Our study highlights <italic toggle="yes">Amy1</italic> as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands in the lunar gravity environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lunar gravity</kwd><kwd>salivary gland</kwd><kwd>small G protein</kwd><kwd>amy1</kwd><kwd>microarray</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>The author(s) declare that financial support was received for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

It is important to elucidate the medical risks that humans face when living in a space environment, such as the oxidative stress caused by cosmic radiation (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Overbey et al., 2019</xref>) and mechanical stress caused by microgravity (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Dadwal et al., 2019</xref>). Artificial imitation of these environments may provide an understanding of gravitational physiology and determine how to avoid space stress.</p><p>A previous study showed that the gravitational threshold in the space environment provides a platform for exploring the mechanisms controlling the skeletal muscle response to alterations in gravity (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 2023</xref>). Elucidation of the functional changes and molecular mechanisms involved may lead to the development of strategies to maintain human health during future long-term space travel. The musculoskeletal system and muscle movement controlled by somatic nerves have been studied previously in space and artificial gravitational environments (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Juhl et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 2023</xref>). Although studies on the heart rate and activity rhythms controlled by the autonomic nervous system in space are addressed (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Blaber et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), research on the salivary glands, which are representative of local fluid balance regulation by the system, are limited. Saliva maintains the moist environment of oral tissues and is essential not only for feeding, mastication, and swallowing food but also for oral functions such as digestion, and articulation. In addition, saliva has antibacterial properties that help control the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth, contributing to oral hygiene and prevention of dental issues such as cavities and gum disease. Saliva helps maintain pH balance in the mouth and neutralizes the acids produced by bacteria, thereby reducing the risk of tooth decay and erosion. It plays a role in taste perception by dissolving food particles and allowing them to interact with the taste buds in the tongue. Therefore, saliva is a multifunctional fluid that contributes significantly to oral and digestive health. Insufficient saliva production, known as dry mouth or xerostomia, can lead to various oral health problems and difficulties chewing, swallowing, and speaking. However, little is known about the regulatory mechanisms of salivary secretion during spaceflights.</p><p>In this study, we collected submandibular glands from mice exposed to artificial lunar gravity.</p><p>Among the major salivary glands, the large amount of saliva secretion comes from the submandibular gland. Therefore, we thought that changes in salivary gland mRNA due to environmental changes might be more clearly observed in the submandibular gland compared to other salivary glands. In addition, the submandibular gland is a mixed gland, and we considered that it would be a good model to observe the control mechanism and balance of protein secretion and water secretion by the sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, i.e., under autonomic regulation.</p><p>Artificial lunar gravity was developed using multiple artificial gravity research systems (MARS) that use a centrifuge to create artificial gravity, enabling comparative studies between the effects of gravity and microgravity in space (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Shimbo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Shiba et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Okada et al., 2021</xref>). This system has contributed to analysis of sulfur metabolomic and transcriptomic changes in the liver (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Kurosawa et al., 2021</xref>), metabolic effects in adipose tissues (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Uruno et al., 2021</xref>), blood parameters changes (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Shimizu et al., 2023</xref>), bone mineralization, blood pressure, and lipid metabolism in mouse kidneys (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>) during space travel. This study investigated the basic foundations for oral clinical medicine under lunar gravity. We sought to understand whether lunar gravity (1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) influence the mRNA expression in salivary glands during space flight. Using the developed MARS, two independent missions (MHU-4 and MHU-5) were conducted in the space. Using the MARS system, we analyzed the mRNA expression of the whole submandibular gland tissue of mice raised under lunar (1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>) and Earth gravity (1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>2 Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1 Animals</title><p>C57BL/6&#160;J male mice (Stock #000664) obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, United States) and Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA, United States) were used for the MHU-4 and -5 missions. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) (Protocol Number: No. 018-011D for MHU-4 and No. 018-036D for MHU-5), Explora Biolabs (Study Number: No. EB19-003 for MHU-4 and No. SP19-003 for MHU-5), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) (Protocol Number: No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-4 and No. JAXA MHU-5/FLT-19-121 for MHU-5). All experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines and applicable laws of Japan and the United States.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>2.2 MHU missions</title><p>The ground control group (GC) comprised of six age-matched (9-week-old) male C57BL/6&#160;J mice per mission, maintained on Earth under the same conditions as those aboard the International Space Station (ISS). A detailed description of the space flight experiments has been previously reported (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Hayashi et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>In the MHU-4 mission, six 9-week-old male C57BL/6&#160;J mice in a transportation cage unit were launched aboard SpX-17 on 7 May 2019, from the NASA Kennedy Space Center and were then transported to the ISS.

The crew only needed to periodically refill the water and replenish the food, reducing the workload of the crew. The water dispenser was based on a balloon for injecting medicines, and drinking water was supplied by pressurizing the water using the elasticity of the balloon. The amount of water in the balloon was able to be detected by a sensor when it was full and when a certain amount of water had been consumed from full. For feeding, a spring was used to push out integrally molded food to the feeding surface. Food needed to be replenished once a week, but the food in this device was in cartridge form, making it easy for the crew to replace the cartridges.</p><p>All the mice from each mission were sacrificed on the second day after returning to the Earth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>2.3 Sample collection and preparation</title><p>Submandibular glands were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Wako, Osaka, Japan) for 1&#8211;2&#160;d at 4&#160;&#176;C before replacing the paraformaldehyde with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The MHU-4 mission samples were processed in the United States in June 2019, and the MHU-5 mission samples were processed in the United States in April 2020. After approximately 40 d, the samples were treated with different concentrations of methanol, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%, for 30&#160;min each and then maintained in 100% methanol.

To identify up- or downregulated genes, we calculated Z-scores [Z] and ratios (non-log scaled fold-change) from the normalized signal intensities of each probe for comparison between the control and experimental samples. The criteria for upregulated genes was Z-score &#8805;2.0 and ratio &#8805;1.5-fold and for downregulated genes was Z-score &#8804; &#8722;2.0 and ratio &#8804;0.66.

Salivary proteins are synthesized in acinar cells. Based on the genetic information in acinar cells, salivary proteins are synthesized in ribosomes, pass through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, become vesicles, and are transported to the Golgi apparatus. Intravesicular proteins that undergo modifications, such as glycosylation, in the Golgi apparatus are concentrated and stored in secretory granules. Small G proteins such as Ras and Rab families function salivary secretion, as guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins with a molecular weight of 20&#8211;30&#160;kDa. This hydrolysis results in inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP). Small G proteins act as molecular switches that bind specific target molecules and transmit intracellular signals. GDP/GTP exchange proteins (GEF) are regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The combined GTP and GDP states function as molecular switches corresponding to the on/off states. Activity regulation is temporally and spatially controlled and functions as a biotimer. Small G proteins are classified into five families, and regulate various cellular functions. <italic toggle="yes">Rap</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">Rab</italic> signaling plays an important role in saliva and amylase secretion (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">D'Silva et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Sabbatini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Gomi et al., 2017</xref>). Our study showed no increase in the expression of mRNA related to receptors for noradrenaline secreted from sympathetic nerves involved in protein secretion, where is the upstream of salivary secretion system, while upregulations of Rap/Rab signaling for transporting intracellular vesicles and v-SNARE (Vamp8) to secrete amylase via exocytosis at apical side of acinar cells were observed in the 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> environment.</p><p>In addition, salivary secretion requires high levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) not only for salivary secretion by maintaining intracellular K<sup>+</sup> concentration in acinar cells, but also for modification of saliva by reabsorption and secretion in ductal cells of submandibular gland. Our GSEA data show that a set of mRNAs involved in oxidative phosphorylation was highly upregulated under 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> lunar gravity in MHU-4 and -5. Plus, mRNAs in association of ionic transport coupled with ATP synthesis or hydrolysis were also upregulated at 1/6&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> lunar gravity compared to that under 1&#160;<italic toggle="yes">g</italic> in the MHU-4 and -5 missions. We also hypothesized that changes in gravity may induce changes in body fluids, resulting in excessive fluid inflow into the submandibular gland. Our data shows downregulation of mechanosensitive ion channels such as <italic toggle="yes">TRP</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Piezo</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ASIC</italic> channels, however. Fluid balance fluctuates when gravity changes, shifting fluid to the upper body and creating a situation where the astronauts have edema around the salivary glands, which causes mechanical stress. It is possible that the mRNA levels of these mechanosensitive ion channels in the submandibular gland decrease because of a function that restores them to their normal state.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that changes in the gravitational environment induce qualitative changes in salivary secretion function and that multiple genes may be involved in maintaining salivary secretion homeostasis in the space environment. Overall, our data suggested that lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via vesicular transport and exocytosis mediated by Rap/Rab signaling and Vamp8 at apical side of acinar cells (<xref rid="F11" ref-type="fig">Figure 11</xref>). However, we have not shown the functional assay as amylase secretion in this study. To clarify the correlation mechanisms between these mRNAs and amylase secretion, it will need to be verified whether any effect on amylase secretion is caused by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments in acinar cells. Further research on salivary secretion signal and gene regulation may contribute to the future monitoring of the physical and mental health of humans living in space as well as the improvement of oral medicine.</p><fig position="float" id="F11" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 11</label><caption><p>Upregulation of salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis via Vamp8 under the lunar gravity. <bold>(A)</bold> Graphical scheme shows signaling pathway for salivary secretion in acinar cells.
