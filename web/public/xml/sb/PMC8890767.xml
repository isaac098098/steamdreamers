Despite active vaccination programs and implementation of social distancing parameters, the number of infections and deaths in the world remain significantly high and new highly transmissible strains are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic betacoronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) transmitted via person to person mainly through air droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>) and sometimes fecal-oral routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), potentially infecting nasal, lung, and intestinal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Currently, there are no highly effective therapeutics to treat COVID-19, making effective prevention an essential public health goal.</p><p id="Par6">SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is initiated by molecular interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoproteins (also known as S-protein) and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) displayed on the host cell surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Several viruses from different virus families are known to utilize HSPG as their attachment receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>), for example, parainfluenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>), cytomegalovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>), and herpes simplex virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the S-protein-HSPG interaction is followed by binding of S-protein to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). Binding of SARS-CoV-2 to host HSPG is essential for the progression of virus entry and infection cycle, as evidenced by disruption of virus entry by exogenously administered sulfated polysaccharides, which compete with cell surface HSPGs. The sulfated polysaccharides that have already been investigated as anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents include heparin, heparin derivatives and glycosaminoglycan analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). These sulfated polysaccharides are likely to remain effective against emerging variants of concern (VOC) that partially evade vaccine-induced immune response due to differences in polysaccharide and antibody binding sites on SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>) and the conserved nature of the polybasic furin cleavage site, one of the major sites of heparin interaction and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Since the major route of virus transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly initiated by airborne droplet infection of nasal tissues, it is reasonable to consider the design of potentially novel anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents, like UFH, for intranasal administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Such an approach may lead to the discovery of novel anticoronaviral agents with high efficacy, fast mechanisms of action, wide therapeutic windows, and non-invasive self-administration protocols for a possible prophylactic use. While heparin administration by injection is already FDA-approved for other uses, potential antiviral utility against coronaviruses is just being explored. Unfortunately, little is known about the effects of UFH, particularly regarding the potential consequences of repeated administration to the nasal cavity. Preliminary tests regarding clearance, pharmacokinetics, and safety must be undertaken prior to implementing the actual clinical nasal application of a potentially useful anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, like heparin, which is already FDA-approved for use by administration via other routes. In this work, a series of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> pharmacological and toxicological aspects of intranasally administered UFH in mice were investigated. Blood histology, coagulation, olfactory behavior, drug clearance, and adverse outcomes were assessed in mice, and safety was evaluated in a small healthy human sample population. Primary objectives for the human study were the measurement of systemic bioavailability based on increased blood coagulation properties using aPTT and INR measurements. Platelet count was also observed to detect any potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Finally, episodes of epistaxis were monitored to measure for localized damage to mucus membranes and/or localized anti-coagulation activity.</p><p id="Par8">Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the intranasal administration of UFH solution will readily deliver the UFH to the nasal passages and will be safe with no or minimal toxic effects in mice or humans. Results indicate efficient delivery, extended retention of heparin in the nasal passages, and clearance of intranasally administered UFH with no major adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par9">Heparin Sodium Injection, USP was purchased in two different formulations for human intranasal administration: 5000 USP units per mL (NDC: 71288&#8211;403-10) and 10,000 USP units per mL (NDC: 00409&#8211;2721-30).

Mice were habituated to the food stimulus of choice, Teddy Grahams (Nabisco, Hanover, New Jersey), at least 24-h prior to behavioral testing to confirm its rewarding stimulus. Mice were food deprived (water ad lib) immediately following Day 14 of IN drug administration to motivate subjects, and tested 24-h later (signs of distress were monitored while food deprived). On test day, the subject was placed in a test chamber containing 3&#160;cm of fresh 1/8 in corncob bedding for a 15-min trial, with the food stimulus buried approximately 1&#160;cm below the bedding surface in a randomly assigned corner of the cage. The subject successfully completed the assay when it uncovered the food stimulus and began to eat, using one or both forepaws on the food. Latency to uncover and eat the food served as the dependent measure. Each trial had a maximum latency of 900&#160;s. Immediately following testing, mice were returned to their home cage, and ad lib access to food was restored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blood Histology</title><p id="Par16">At the time of exsanguination, 20&#160;&#956;L of whole blood was removed and smeared on coverglass for histological assessment.

Unlike residence in the lungs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>), the mucosa of the nasal cavity is constantly cleared into the stomach which can drive intranasal drug clearance. However, heparin has many physical and chemical features that are not common in nasally administered drugs, being much larger and having high negative charge density. To test the lifetime of heparin in the nasal cavity, we labeled heparin at the reducing end with a near-IR chemical dye through an oxime linkage, resulting in a single dye molecule (95&#160;Da) per heparin molecule (avg. ~15,000&#160;Da).

No adverse effects were reported during the acute phase, so the chronic phase was performed at 2000&#160;U/day administered as one spray per nostril daily to monitor for longer-term effects after fourteen consecutive days of daily dosing.

We observed no signs of nasal inflammation, epistaxis, alterations on platelet count that could lead to potential heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and significant changes on the aPTT analysis. Our findings revealed no overt signs of toxicity nor disruption of olfactory functions in mice administered UFH intranasally over two weeks at doses up to 60&#160;&#956;g/day. From the findings of <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> imaging, we observed a two-phase clearance of intranasal UFH from the nasal cavity, with protective concentrations still present 12&#160;h post-dosing, in which approximately 2% of the starting dose remained in the cavity until background levels were again reached after 12 additional hours. No significant changes were observed for aPTT, PT/INR, and platelet counts in human volunteers, indicating that intranasal administration of heparin is tolerable at doses up to at least 2000&#160;U/day for at least 14&#160;days. The lack of both local irritation and systemic bioavailability suggest that intranasal heparin may have a high tolerance with a potentially large therapeutic window for preventing viral infections from respiratory viruses that use heparan sulfate as a co-receptor, including SARS-CoV-2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
