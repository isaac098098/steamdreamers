Because of the severity of these infections, <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> pathogenesis has been extensively investigated. However, prior to infections, <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> lives in the gut and can breach the GI tract to infect the host (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p id="P3">One host setting associated with enrichment for <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> in the GI tract is alcohol use disorder (AUD), a condition in which individuals have lost the ability to control or stop their alcohol consumption (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Estimates suggest roughly 2.3 billion people in the world consume alcohol and over 5% of the world&#8217;s adult population has an AUD (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> is enriched in the fecal microbiome in individuals with AUD (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) and contributes to the progression and severity of ALD (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Immune responses to intestinal fungi correlate with a reduced 5-year survival in those with ALD (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), showing that changes in abundance of intestinal fungi have vital consequences to the host.</p><p id="P4">The gut microbiota can also affect host behavior via effects on the gut-brain axis (GBA). The GBA is defined as the bidirectional communication between the GI tract and the brain (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The GBA has been implicated in many disorders ranging from autism to addiction (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Initial work characterizing the GBA in AUD found dysbiosis in the GI tract can contribute to depression and craving (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Specific bacteria have been found that contribute to the control of factors crucial to alcohol craving (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Further, fecal microbiota transplants in mice and humans can modulate ethanol preference and craving respectively (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). These findings support the model that changes to the microbiome in AUD can regulate ethanol consumption.</p><p id="P5">As a mechanism linking microbiome changes to the GBA in AUD, we investigated the role of prostaglandin E2 (PGE<sub>2</sub>), an eicosanoid compound synthesized from arachidonic acid. A previous study showed that treatment with PGE<sub>2</sub> reduced ethanol consumption in rats (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Serum PGE<sub>2</sub> levels have previously been shown to be higher in antibiotic-treated mice with GI colonization by <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Further, we previously showed that <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization in mice dysregulated endocannabinoids (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), another set of compounds that utilize arachidonic acid as a precursor (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The arachidonic acid-derived host lipidome is thus altered in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice. We therefore tested for a role for PGE<sub>2</sub> in reducing ethanol consumption in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice.</p><p id="P6">In this study, we show that <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> GI colonization in mice reduced their ethanol consumption. <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice had elevated serum PGE<sub>2</sub> compared to mock-colonized mice, and injection of uncolonized mice with dimethyl-PGE<sub>2</sub> reduced ethanol consumption. The reduction in ethanol consumption in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice was reversed by antagonizing receptors for PGE<sub>2</sub><italic toggle="yes">. C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice exhibited altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum, a more rapid acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion, and were more sensitive to ethanol-induced motor coordination deficits which could be reversed by PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonist treatment.

Mice received either vehicle or one of four different concentrations of dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> (25, 50, 100, 300 ug/kg) by subcutaneous injection each day. Lower concentrations (25 or 50 ug/kg) of dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> led to low-level decreases in ethanol preference and consumption, and higher concentrations led to larger decreases compared to PBS-injected mice (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Thus, dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> injection in mice decreased ethanol consumption in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the model that elevation of endogenous PGE<sub>2</sub> results in decreased ethanol consumption.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>EP Receptor Antagonism Increases Ethanol Consumption and Preference to Mock-Colonized Levels.</title><p id="P11">Based on these results, we hypothesized that PGE<sub>2</sub> is a key driver of reduced ethanol preference in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice.

Therefore, we tested whether <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice were more susceptible to ethanol sedation, ethanol-induced motor coordination defects, and depressant effects of ethanol (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p id="P20">The first experiment was the open field activity test (OFT), which measures how susceptible C57BL/6 mice are to the depressant effects of alcohol based on the decrease in distance traveled in the OFT following ethanol injection (1.5 g/kg) (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Mice were injected with ethanol (dose) or control (sterile saline [SS]) and distance traveled in 10 minutes in the OFT was measured. Results are expressed relative to the SS-injected mice within each experimental trial (mock or <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized) (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8B</xref>).

The time for the mice to lose their righting reflex after the injection is termed LORR onset. Mock or <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice that had received SS injections the previous three days, or mock mice that received ethanol the previous 3 days had no differences in LORR onset (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8C</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice that received ethanol injections on the previous 3 days showed a significantly shorter LORR onset compared to all groups. Blood ethanol concentration from serum collected at the time of loss of righting reflex showed a trend towards higher levels in these mice (<xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8D</xref>).

Our results with EP1/EP2 antagonists show that PGE<sub>2</sub> signaling plays a significant role in modifying mouse ethanol preference. Further, injection of uncolonized mice with dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> reduced ethanol consumption. There was a somewhat dose-dependent response as low concentrations of dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> (25&#8211;50 ug/kg) reduced consumption moderately and higher doses of dm-PGE<sub>2</sub> (100&#8211;300ug/kg) reduced ethanol preference and consumption more strongly.</p><p id="P26">Antibiotic treated mice with <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> gut colonization have been previously shown to exhibit elevated serum PGE-m levels (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Mice treated with antibiotics but not inoculated with fungi showed a modest increase in serum PGE-m levels and this level was sufficient to promote inflammatory cell responses. <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice in our study, which did not use antibiotics, also showed modestly increased serum concentrations of PGE-m and PGE-m concentration correlated with ethanol preference. These results indicate that modest increases in serum PGE<sub>2</sub> are associated with changes in host immune responses and behavior. PGE<sub>2</sub> in circulation may be directly involved in these changes or may serve as a marker indicating higher levels of PGE<sub>2</sub> in multiple organs. In fact, we saw evidence of increased PGE<sub>2</sub> by correlations with <italic toggle="yes">Ep</italic> expression in all regions of the brain examined.</p><p id="P27">PGE<sub>2</sub> has previously been shown to alter the permeability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) by inducing alterations in endothelial permeability or by stimulating the retraction of pericytes from the surface of the BBB (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> has also been shown to induce vasodilation (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Vasodilatory effects and BBB alterations could lead to higher amounts of PGE<sub>2</sub> in the brain and reduce ethanol consumption. These results support the model that, as PGE<sub>2</sub> in the circulation elevates above normal fluctuating ranges, BBB permeability increases, and more PGE<sub>2</sub> can enter the brain, resulting in correlations between its concentration in serum and <italic toggle="yes">Ep1/Ep2</italic> receptor expression in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice.</p><p id="P28">Synergy between the effects of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization and the effects of ethanol were also observed. Mice that received both ethanol and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> were the only group with significantly reduced locomotion in the OFT. <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice that received multiple injections with ethanol showed significantly shorter time to LORR onset than <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice that received one injection. Ethanol also affects the BBB through changes in integrity and permeability (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Inflammatory molecules such as LPS can also synergistically increase BBB permeability (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The effects of ethanol on the BBB may thus synergize with the effects of PGE<sub>2</sub>, resulting in significant behavioral effects in colonized mice. Saccharin preference may not be reduced by <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization because of the lack of an additional insult to the BBB.</p><p id="P29">PGE<sub>2</sub> has previously been shown to affect the dopamine system. Dopamine is critical for habit, reward, and aversion formation (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). PGE<sub>2</sub> treatment altered reward learning to morphine in mice (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>), and has been shown to alter DRD signaling and behavior following cocaine ingestion (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). We observed that <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice showed altered expression of dopamine receptors in the dorsal striatum. Expression of one of the receptors, <italic toggle="yes">Drd2</italic>, was significantly decreased in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonized mice and low-dose dm-PGE<sub>2</sub>-injected mice. Interestingly, expression in the PFC and NAc did not indicate similar changes to the dopamine system, and other genes implicated in addiction such as neuropeptide Y receptors, opioid receptors (Mu and Delta), proopiomelanocortin (<italic toggle="yes">Pomc</italic>), and <italic toggle="yes">Fos</italic> were unchanged. Significant expression differences of the Mu opioid receptor between mock and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice appeared to be due to differences in ethanol consumption. These results indicate an altered regulation of the dopamine system in the DS observed in mice with low level increases in systemic PGE<sub>2</sub> concentrations.</p><p id="P30">Furthermore, when <italic toggle="yes">Drd</italic> expression in the DS was plotted against total ethanol consumption, significant positive or negative correlations were observed. DRD1 and DRD2 receptors in the dorsal striatum have well defined, consistent roles. DRD1 signaling in the DS is mostly involved with reinforcement or reward learning and DRD2 is most commonly involved with aversion-formation (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). A positive correlation between <italic toggle="yes">Drd1</italic> expression and total ethanol consumption was observed in mock-colonized mice, but not in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice suggesting dysregulation of the relationship of DRD1/reinforcement in these mice. Additionally, a negative correlation between <italic toggle="yes">Drd2</italic> expression and total ethanol consumption in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice suggested that aversion to ethanol could develop. Therefore, there could be a lack of reinforcement learning, an active aversion, or a combination of both, that leads to lower ethanol preference in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice. Results from the CTA suggest an aversion-dominated phenotype because colonized mice showed a more rapid acquisition of conditioned taste aversion. These findings support the conclusion that aversion to ethanol develops more readily in <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice.</p><p id="P31">When conducting other behavioral tests, we found that <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice injected with ethanol showed increased LORR onset, decreased locomotion in the open field test (OFT), and further impaired performance on the balance beam. The performance on the balance beam could be restored to mock-colonized performance by EP1/EP2 antagonists. These results suggest that PGE<sub>2</sub> impact on EP1 and EP2 receptors could contribute to motor control following ethanol intoxication. The depressant and sedative effects of ethanol detected in the OFT and LORR tests could be driven by other systems impacted by <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization such as the endocannabinoid system (ECS) (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Both therapeutic manipulation and gene knockouts of the ECS modulated LORR and OFT phenotypes (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Effects of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization on this pathway (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) could play a role in these phenotypes.</p><p id="P32">All of the experiments described in this communication were done with ethanol na&#239;ve mice. The effects of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization on mice chronically exposed to ethanol are currently unknown. There could be an altered effect of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonization on the host in the setting of AUD and/or chronic stress. Low DRD2 receptor abundance has been shown in individuals with AUD and predisposes mice to stress-induced increases in ethanol consumption (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). If DRD2 receptor abundance is reduced in humans with <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization, as it is in colonized mice, these individuals may consume more ethanol under stress, possibly exacerbating ethanol consumption in AUD. However, our study focused only on initial alcohol consumption and these effects of <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization in individuals with AUD and/or chronic stress are currently unstudied. This remains an area of important future research.</p><p id="P33">In summary, we have shown that GI colonization by <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> elevates serum PGE<sub>2</sub> and these changes correlate with changes in <italic toggle="yes">Ep</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Drd</italic> receptor expression in the dorsal striatum. <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic> colonization decreased ethanol consumption and preference in C57BL/6 mice. These decreases in ethanol consumption correlated with changes in dopamine receptor expression and <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>-colonized mice showed altered behavioral effects of ethanol.

Outside of this, the impact of intestinal fungi on alcohol-use disorder (AUD) had been unstudied. As AUD is a complex disorder characterized by high relapse rates, and there are only 3 FDA-approved therapies for the maintenance of abstinence, it is important to study novel AUD contributors to find new therapeutic targets. Here we show that an intestinal fungus, <italic toggle="yes">C. albicans</italic>, can alter mammalian ethanol consumption through an immune modulator, prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub>. The results highlight novel contributors to AUD-related phenotypes and further implicate the gut-brain axis in AUD. Future studies could lead to new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of AUD.</p></boxed-text></floats-group></article></pmc-articleset>
