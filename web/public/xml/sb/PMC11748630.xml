For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Computational biology and bioinformatics</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Risk factors</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-license-ref</meta-name><meta-value>CC BY-NC-ND</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#169; Springer Nature Limited 2025</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Rodent studies demonstrate that spaceflight negatively impacts liver function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Astronaut studies including the seminal NASA Twins Study also reveal a theme of lipid dysregulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Despite these findings, there has been relatively little research studying the impact of microgravity or space radiation on the liver, with more research emphasis on central nervous system effects and carcinogenesis. This is a key knowledge gap considering the disruption of such a critical organ could impact astronaut health and jeopardize the success of future long-term space missions. Identifying the genetic and molecular mechanisms implicated in spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction is required as a first step in precisely mitigating those deleterious effects. Traditional statistical methods identify correlations which may or may not be spurious, especially in high-dimensional, high-throughput data analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard for identifying non-spurious, causal relationships between dependent and independent variables<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, such experiments can be very expensive and time consuming, or logistically infeasible, especially in a spaceflight environment where sample sizes are limited. Instead, we turn to new machine learning (ML) approaches to identify genes in transcriptomic data predictive of a lipid metabolic response from spaceflight and ground control rodent liver samples.</p><p id="Par3">Tools which are commonly used to analyze high-dimensional data, and ML algorithms in general, share an intrinsic flaw. They discover those patterns in data which minimize training error, but training data are often flawed by selection bias, label bias, capture bias, and negative set bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Algorithms which train on biased datasets inherit these data biases. Minimizing training error encourages algorithms to indiscriminately absorb all the correlations found in training data, real or spurious. Spurious correlations resulting from data biases are unrelated to the true underlying signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Recently, disambiguating true correlations from spurious ones has been studied in the context of causal inference. For this reason, we leverage tools from the causal inference domain to identify genes which are robustly correlated with a phenotype. While such genes are putatively causal, validating true causality is beyond the scope of this research. In this research, we use CRISP&#8212;an ensemble machine learning platform developed by the Frontier Development Laboratory (FDL) 2020 Astronaut Health team<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> to enhance biological and medical research with heterogeneous and high-dimensional observational data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The FDL team used CRISP to identify genetic drivers that differentiate two subtypes of colorectal cancer and to implicate operational taxonomic units of the associated microbiome.</p><p id="Par4">The algorithms in the CRISP platform are based on the concept of invariance as a proxy for causal inference. Invariance is a property of a feature which reflects how well a classification algorithm performs using that feature to predict a response invariantly; that is, on data which were generated in different environments, under different circumstances, different conditions, or using different interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. An algorithm based on invariance can identify those features that predict the target label regardless of the background data generating processes that gave rise to the dataset. The classic example is a machine learning classifier built to distinguish images of cows from images of camels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A machine learning classifier that is overfit to a particular environment may learn that a cow is an animal that lives in green pastures while a camel is an animal that lives in beige deserts. Given a cow on a sandy beach, this classifier would likely call it a camel. By contrast, a classifier based on invariance would be optimized to ignore the background environment and learn the salient features which truly distinguish a cow from a camel, such as the dimensions of the neck and legs and the shape of the face. Classification algorithms which exploit invariance promote learning correlations that are stable across training environments, as these are expected to persist on out-of-distribution data (i.e. data generated in environments not seen by the algorithm during training) and therefore be robustly correlated to and more likely causal of the response variable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this research, we leverage several data transformations for augmenting the dataset that additionally provide an environment in which to leverage the CRISP invariance strategy. We use CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a high lipid density phenotype in space-flown mice liver tissue. We establish a binary threshold of lipid density using scalar values associated with oil red O (ORO) stained tissue. To compare our method with traditional differential gene expression tools, we use EdgeR and DESeq2. We also compare our results with those derived from generic machine learning classifiers including random forest and empirical risk minimization. Overall, we find that CRISP identifies a biologically relevant set of genes which are uniquely predictive of a high lipid density response in space-flown mice. Gene set enrichment and pathway analyses reveal that the dysfunctional regulation of the genes identified by CRISP is implicated in the spectrum of diseases caused by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The mice in the experiment flight group were only in space for a maximum of 54&#160;days, yet their gene expression profiles were altered significantly enough to manifest markers of NAFLD. NASA has gathered a significant amount of biomedical data on the effect of short-term spaceflight (&lt;&#8201;6&#160;months), from the astronauts of the Apollo missions to those who fly on the International Space Station (ISS). What matters now is not merely the impact of being in space, but rather the impact of living there. Surviving long-term spaceflight (&gt;&#8201;6&#160;months) is necessary for the success of the planned Artemis and Mars missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Our study provides the first machine learning analysis of gene expression predictive of a disease-related response to spaceflight in the liver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods and data</title><p id="Par6">The data we used for our experiment include transcriptomic and histology data from the liver tissue of space-flown and ground-control mice.

These datasets were generated from three rodent research (RR) missions: RR-1 CASIS, RR-1 NASA, and RR-3. Two different strains of mice were used: C57 and Balb/C. The RR-1 CASIS experiment was designed to study the effects of microgravity of C57 mice on muscle degeneration due to spaceflight (OSD-47). The RR-1 NASA mission was designed to validate the experimental hardware and scientific capabilities on the International Space Station (OSD-48). The RR-3 mission was designed to study countermeasures in Balb/C mice for loss of mass in muscle and bone that have been observed in spaceflight (OSD-137 and OSD-168).

Gonzalez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and others have shown that while data preprocessing is a necessary step in a machine learning pipeline, there isn&#8217;t much agreement as to which is the best. Some data transformations are more volatile than others. A data transformation may change the data so drastically that it destroys some of the underlying signals of interest. This lack of data preprocessing standard exists in transcriptomic data analysis as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In our research, instead of choosing one pre-processing method, we used several methods as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. This technique of adding differently transformed samples to a dataset is referred to as data augmentation and is a common practice in machine learning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

We leveraged CRISP to identify genes potentially causal of a phenotype. There are 2 types of algorithms in CRISP: one based on invariant causal prediction (ICP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; and one based on invariant risk minimization (IRM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. There is a linear and non-linear version of each of these algorithms. The linear versions use linear combinations of the feature space to construct a binary output, and the non-linear versions use non-linear combinations (multi-layer perceptrons with non-linear activation functions) of the feature space to construct a binary output. Both algorithms rely on invariance as a proxy for causality, and invariance in turn relies on having data partitioned by known interventions or perturbations. Each of these methods trains a model using a training set, selects model hyper-parameters using a validation set, and provides a final model accuracy on a held-out test set. CRISP partitions the data into different environments such that the model is trained on data from one environment and then validated and tested on the data from the other environments. CRISP uses two methods of feature reduction to reduce the number of variables to search. The first method removes features whose correlation to the target is below a certain threshold, and the second method uses a multi-layer perceptron to identify the most salient features based on model feature importance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>CRISP configuration</title><p id="Par24">CRISP experiments are configured with several parameters in a JSON configuration file. By default, the test_val_split parameter defines how much data to dedicate for training, testing, and validation. We overrode this default data splitting configuration and explicitly defined the training, testing, and validation data subsets. The training data is used to train the model parameters, the validation data is used to select the optimal set of model hyperparameters, and the test data is held out after the model is trained and validated to report accuracy. It is this held-out test accuracy that we subsequently report on. The max_features parameter defines the number of features each model in the ensemble should find as most predictive of the target. We used the default value of 20 in our CRISP experiment. The data_options parameter defines the file location containing the dataset, which columns in that dataset are to be used as predictors, which column is the environment variable, and which column is the target variable. There are several other parameters that may be configured in this JSON configuration file which get consumed by the machine learning algorithms configured in the ensemble.

Ensembles are used to combine a set of multiple &#8220;weak&#8221; learners into a single &#8220;strong&#8221; learner to minimize training errors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Each model in the ensemble is trained on the dataset to identify the features most predictive of the target. After training, each model selects the features (20 by default) which it found as most predictive of the target. For the linear models&#8212;linear invariant risk minimization (linear IRM) and linear invariant causal prediction (linear ICP)&#8212;the features which are most predictive are those whose coefficients of the linear model have the highest absolute values. For non-linear models&#8212;non-linear invariant risk minimization (non-linear IRM) and non-linear invariant causal prediction (non-linear ICP)&#8212;the most predictive features are selected through sensitivity analysis (the features which have the highest impact on the response variable). After each model has selected its top-most predictive features, the ensemble votes to elect a single set of (by default, 20) features to present as the final result of the experiment. Non-Causal Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and random forest (RF) are not causal predictors and do not participate in CRISP&#8217;s selection of the features. Non-causal ERM relies on statistical minimization of risk or error, while RF is another non-causal method which combines decision trees for a classification result. They are included in the experiment only as a basis of comparison to the causal predictors (non-linear IRM, linear ICP, non-linear ICP, and linear IRM). CRISP attributes the highest weight to the feature that the highest accuracy model gives the largest coefficient (or highest sensitivity). Conversely, the lowest ranking feature from the worst performing model will be attributed the lowest weight. Furthermore, the higher degree of concordance across the ensemble (i.e. how many models found the feature in their top 20 list), the higher the weighted coefficient of that feature.

While random forest lays no claim to identify features causal of a target, the algorithm is one of the best-performing and highly used ML classification algorithms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The CRISP ensemble uses the RandomForestClassifier module from version 0.24.2 of the scikit-learn package. Like its causal counterparts, the random forest algorithm calculates a feature importance metric which can be used to define confidence in the results. Among the top 20 genes that random forest identified as predictive of the lipid density response, none of them are involved in the lipid metabolic process according to the NCBI Gene tool. Neither the ShinyGO nor the GSEA enrichment tools found any overlapping pathways or gene ontologies using these 20 genes as input. We conclude that the random forest classifier found spurious correlations between the expression of those 20 genes and the lipid density response.

ERM uses the canonical minimization of the sum of the squares of the residuals as its unconditional objective function. It does not partition the data into environments like IRM. As such, it is perhaps the closest comparison to the linear IRM and non-linear IRM results from CRISP. Among the 20 genes that ERM identified as predictive of the lipid density response, none of them are involved in the lipid metabolic process according to NCBI. Neither the ShinyGO nor the GSEA enrichment tools found any overlapping pathways or gene ontologies using these 20 genes as input. We conclude that the ERM classifier found spurious correlations between the expression of those 20 genes and the lipid density response. The 20 genes which ERM found as most predictive of the lipid density phenotype are shown in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par54">The CRISP platform trains an ensemble of binary classifiers on data in one environment and validates and tests them using the data from the other environments. Separating the environments in this way ensures that the ensemble algorithms are rewarded for finding correlations that are independent of biases in the data generating processes. Classifying data independently of the environment is the definition of invariance in this context and leads to more robustly correlated results. Using the CRISP ensemble, we&#8217;ve identified a set of genes which are predictive of high and low lipid density. These genes are significantly associated with gene sets and genetic pathways that are consistent with NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction. On the other hand, machine learning methods such as empirical risk minimization and random forest do not distinguish between spurious and non-spurious correlations. In our experiment, their top 20 genes are not biologically related to lipid metabolism, despite the random forest classifier having the highest held-out test accuracy (100%) of all the models in predicting lipid density.</p><p id="Par55">The DESeq2 package did not find any genes significantly correlated to our phenotype. The EdgeR package found 6 genes whose expression was significantly correlated to the lipid density response variable&#8212;one of which (<italic toggle="yes">Star</italic>) was also found by CRISP. However, gene set enrichment and pathway analysis tools found a wide variety of conditions and processes associated with these 6 genes, leaving the results difficult to interpret. We attribute these quantitative and qualitative differences in results to the environment invariance modeling approach that the CRISP ML algorithms use in conjunction with the data augmentation methods we leveraged.</p><p id="Par56">As opposed to the non-specific pathways enriched by the EdgeR genes, the CRISP genes enrich lipid metabolism pathways including cholesterol, fatty acid, and NAFLD pathways&#8212;all of which are consistent with using lipid density as a response in our machine learning models. The NAFLD pathway is significantly enriched by the CRISP gene result set and includes <italic toggle="yes">Cyp2e1</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">Fasn</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">Scd1</italic> genes with a 0.014 strength of association, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. As noted in Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref>, the literature is consistent in finding these genes implicated in experiments on NAFLD. Moreover, the SPOKE knowledge graph found MASLD (the new name for NAFLD) to be the most significantly associated disease ontology with the CRISP gene result set.</p><p id="Par57">The use of data augmentation in this CRISP experiment is crucial. Not only does augmentation provide known perturbations of the data as required by CRISP, data augmentation also provides more samples to train, test, and validate the ensemble of machine learning classifiers. Even so, having more samples than 51 would enrich the underlying gene expression signals which would lead to even more robust correlations. We therefore recommend future spaceflight experiments to increase the cohort size and make the liver a standard tissue to collect, process, and analyze. We acknowledge a caveat that the OSD-137 study used the Balb/c mouse strain, while the other three studies used the C57BL6 strain. These two mouse strains are known to have differing responses to spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, a future study would benefit from further investigating the responses of the different mouse strains in larger cohorts.</p><p id="Par58">To further validate our findings, one could explore other data associated with these same rodents including proteomic and methylation data, as well as leverage existing molecular tests of liver function. A future analysis of the gene expression of ground models of NAFLD may help validate the genes identified here by CRISP. Future work could focus on randomized controlled experiments specifically designed to manipulate the function of each putative gene to verify they do, in fact, cause high or low lipid density in liver tissue. For example, reverse transcriptase PCR or quantitative immunohistochemistry studies on liver samples from controlled experiments could provide key validation results. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) related to fatty liver, steatosis, and NAFLD could be explored to identify the molecular pathways responsible for the lipid density phenotype and to gain a more complete purview of the putative dysfunction. Additionally, to further elucidate a link to human manifestation of NAFLD or similar liver dysfunction, it will be important to address the species differences between mouse and human.</p><p id="Par59">In this research, we provide a novel approach to identify potentially causal genes associated with liver dysfunction during spaceflight. These genes constitute potential biomarkers of NAFLD for targeted monitoring or therapeutics development in the future that would otherwise be more time consuming or impossible to identify with traditional statistical or experimental approaches. Given the expense of randomized controlled experiments, having a targeted set of genes putatively causal of the response is invaluable. While the results of our research link the expression of certain genes to a lipid dysregulation phenotype in liver tissue, our approach can be generalized to other tissues, phenotypes, and even other -omics data. For NASA to embark on longer and more frequent space missions, understanding the impact of spaceflight on biological function is paramount. To this end, there are many data sets in OSDR left to explore, and more are continuing to be published.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
