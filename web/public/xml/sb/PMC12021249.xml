Most experiments require that the animals are synchronized to be at the same specific developmental stage. Bleach synchronization is traditionally used to obtain a population of staged embryos, but the method can have harmful effects on the embryos. The physical separation of differently sized animals is preferred but often difficult to perform because some developmental stages are the same sizes as others. Microfluidic device filters have been used as alternatives, but they are expensive and require customization to scale up the preparation of staged animals. Here, we present a protocol for the synchronization of embryos using mesh filters. Using filtration, we obtained a higher yield of embryos per plate than using the standard bleach synchronization protocol and at a scale beyond microfluidic devices. Importantly, filtration has no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays. In conclusion, we have exploited the differences in the sizes of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> developmental stages to isolate embryo cultures suitable for use in high-throughput assays.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007880</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0229-9651</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Erik C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1751035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0229-9651</contrib-id><name name-style="western"><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Erik C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>E.C.A - Johns Hopkins University start-up funds E.C.A - National Science Foundation CAREER Award (1751035) The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-qastatus</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-live</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-embargo</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-status-released</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-open-access</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-olf</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-manuscript</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-legally-suppressed</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-pdf</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-has-supplement</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-pdf-only</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-suppress-copyright</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-real-version</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-is-scanned-article</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-preprint</meta-name><meta-value>no</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pmc-prop-in-epmc</meta-name><meta-value>yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Raw data and code are available at the following GitHub repository: <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://github.com/njhaver4/2025_Filtrationmanuscript" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/njhaver4/2025_Filtrationmanuscript</ext-link>

</p></notes></front><body><sec id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nematodes of the genus <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis</italic> are an ideal system to study genes, genetic interactions, and evolutionary conserved signaling pathways. The most studied organism of this group is <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, because of its short life cycle, hermaphroditic mating system, cost-effective cultivation, small size, transparency, small genome, and the simplicity of genetic modification and functional testing in a laboratory setting [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> develop through four morphologically distinct larval stages (L1 - L4), before progressing into adults. Most experiments require the nematodes to be at a specific developmental stage because of the distinct morphologies, behaviors, and gene expression patterns of each stage. High-throughput assays such as RNA sequencing, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), drug screens, proteomics, and behavioral assays require a large number of animals at a particular stage. The standard method of obtaining nematodes at a specific developmental stage is by collecting embryos and allowing them to hatch into L1 larvae that are arrested when starved. The synchronous population of L1 larvae is fed and then incubated at the desired temperature until the animals grow to the target developmental stage. Embryos are obtained from the uterus of gravid adults by dissolving the hypodermis using a hypochlorite (bleach) solution (<xref rid="pone.0318143.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). However, different parameters such as the bleaching time and temperature of the bleach solution affect the survival of the embryos [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To control for the variability in the numbers of viable, unaffected animals after bleach synchronization, three independent replicates are typically performed for high-throughput assays, making the process time-consuming [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#8211;<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0318143.g001" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318143.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Comparison of bleach and filtration techniques to collect embryos.</title><p>Bleach synchronization involves dissolving the hypodermis of gravid adults and releasing the embryos. Filtration involves using size-specific filters to separate the embryos from the adults. The figure was created using BioRender.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="pone.0318143.g001.jpg"/></fig><p>To overcome the limitations of bleach synchronization, microfluidic devices can sort animals based on the size differences of each developmental stage [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such devices enable precise control of parameters such as liquid flow, pressure, and temperature enabling effective sorting [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the major drawbacks of such devices are their high cost, lack of scalability to many independent strains, and the requirement to build them, making them inaccessible to many groups.</p><p>Mesh filters of different sizes are a cheaper alternative to microfluidic devices. Separation of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> stages by size has been done using filters of different mesh sizes that allow specific stages to pass through and some stages to be retained on top of the mesh (<xref rid="pone.0318143.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>), [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Filters with different pore sizes are commercially available. For example, Wilson sieves of 5 &#181;m mesh size were used to separate L1 or L2 populations [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], plate-based nylon mesh filters of 11 &#181;m from Millipore MultiScreen were used to purify the L1 stage [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], pluriSelect filters were used to isolate L4 and young adult stages of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], mesh filters have also been used to separate males from hermaphrodites [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and in-house filters were also constructed with 50&#8201;mL conical tubes and monofilament mesh of the required pore size to recover the L4 stage (on 20 &#181;m filters) and day-one adults (on 50 &#181;m filters) [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The examples highlight using mesh filters to isolate specific developmental stages of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic>. However, these other size filtration methods are less efficient when scaling beyond one or a small number of strains. Additionally, the small differences in length and width between consecutive larval stages make it difficult to get a 100% pure culture of a specific stage. For example, the difference in width between the L1 and L2 stages, and L2 and L3 stages is approximately 5.3 &#181;m and 5.1 &#181;m respectively (approximate widths of L1, L2, L3, and L4 larvae are 11.7 &#181;m, 17 &#181;m, 22.1 &#181;m, and 29.5 &#181;m, respectively) [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In contrast, the dimensions of the embryos (50 &#181;m in length and 30 &#181;m in diameter) make it easier to separate from other developmental stages [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Once isolated, the embryos can be cultured to obtain a synchronous population of L1 larvae that can be grown to a synchronized stage-specific population.</p><p>We used filters from pluriSelect to specifically isolate embryos that were laid on an OP50-seeded plate. Based on the widths of the different developmental stages, we conducted sequential filtration using filters of two mesh sizes, 40 &#181;m and 20 &#181;m. The 40 &#181;m filter retained adults and debris. The embryos and larval stages, which are smaller in width, passed through the 40 &#181;m mesh and were collected on the 20 &#181;m mesh. The 20 &#181;m mesh further allowed the smaller larval stages to pass through and the embryos to be retained. Using our technique, we recovered approximately 9,500 embryos from one 6&#8201;cm OP50-seeded plate, compared to approximately 5,000 embryos by bleach synchronization, using the <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> N2 laboratory-adapted strain. To further increase the embryo yield per plate, we incorporated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the M9 buffer (3% w/v) changing the osmolarity and improving embryo pelleting by three-fold. PEG has been used previously in M9 buffers without adverse effects on <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Additionally, PEG has been employed for the encapsulation of various organisms, including <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic>, with no harmful side effects [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We further showed that the embryos obtained by filtration developed into healthier larvae compared to the larvae obtained by bleach synchronization. Furthermore, we found similar or longer (indicating less of an effect) animal lengths after 48 hours of growth from the L1 stage when embryos were collected using filtration compared to bleach and exposed to albendazole, an anthelmintic compound known to inhibit animal development [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In summary, we have developed a protocol to obtain synchronized embryos that improves upon the traditional method of bleach synchronization.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Nematode culture maintenance</title><p>The strains used for the assays were N2, CB4856, CX11271, ECA36, JU775, and MY16.

We began this process by plating a fixed number of embryos (P<sub>0</sub>) to ensure that they would develop and lay embryos (G<sub>1</sub>), which could be collected for filtration without the next generation exhausting the bacterial food (strain OP50) on the plate. P<sub>0</sub> embryos were obtained by bleaching day-one gravid hermaphrodites. The embryo titer was determined by counting the number of embryos in five replicates of 3 &#181;L aliquots. Different numbers of P<sub>0</sub> embryos (250, 300, 400, 450, and 500) were added to 6&#8201;cm OP50-seeded plates. After incubating the plates at 21.5&#176;C for three days, we observed that adding 450 P<sub>0</sub> embryos yielded the highest number of G<sub>1</sub> embryos without food exhaustion. We used 450 P<sub>0</sub> embryos for all subsequent assays.

Specifically, the CB4856, ECA36, JU775, and N2 strains were sensitive to the drug using both bleach and filtration methods (<xref rid="pone.0318143.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="pone.0318143.g007" orientation="portrait"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0318143.g007</object-id><label>Fig 7</label><caption><title>G<sub>1</sub> embryos collected by filtration developed similarly to the G<sub>1</sub> embryos obtained by bleach synchronization when exposed to an anthelmintic compound.</title><p>Box plots showing normalized animal length for larvae developed from G<sub>1</sub> embryos obtained by bleach synchronization or filtration protocols for six <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> strains.

However, because of the harsh chemical nature of bleach, many parameters need to be carefully controlled to ensure the maximum survival of embryos [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. By contrast, filtration takes advantage of the size differences among developmental stages, allowing the separation of embryos with minimal exposure to chemical stress. We have demonstrated that filtration is a better alternative to bleaching to scale up preparations of staged <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> embryos in terms of embryonic yield per plate and with no deleterious effects on larval development. We optimized our pre-filtration conditions based on the <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> reference strain N2 and obtained the highest yield of G<sub>1</sub> embryos by incubating 450 P<sub>0</sub> embryos at 21.5&#176;C for three days [<xref rid="pone.0318143.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, wild strains and mutants have different egg-laying rates and brood sizes, so the number of P<sub>0</sub> embryos to start the assay might need to be adjusted for other strains. We tested two bacterial strains and found OP50 to be the stickiest to help retain the embryos. Other bacteria might be stickier and should be tested in the future. All our assays were done on 6&#8201;cm plates. Higher embryo yields can be obtained by using 10&#8201;cm or larger plates. We have applied our technique to harvest embryos from <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic>. However, embryos from other <italic toggle="yes">Caenorhabditis</italic> species that have similar dimensions to <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> (e.g., <italic toggle="yes">C. briggsae</italic>) can also be isolated. Additionally, the technique could also be adapted to isolate embryos with smaller or larger dimensions by altering the mesh sizes. In summary, our technique provides a robust way of collecting large numbers of <italic toggle="yes">C. elegans</italic> embryos with high purity without the need to subject the animals to bleach.</p></sec><sec id="sec016" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material id="pone.0318143.s001" position="float" content-type="local-data" orientation="portrait"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>OP50-seeded plates retained most of the G<sub>1</sub> embryos after a wash with M9 buffer to remove P<sub>0</sub> adults.</title><p><bold>(A)</bold> A 6&#8201;cm HB101-seeded plate before washing with M9 buffer. <bold>(B)</bold> A 6&#8201;cm HB101-seeded plate after washing with M9 buffer. <bold>(C) A</bold> 6&#8201;cm OP50-seeded plate before washing with M9 buffer.
