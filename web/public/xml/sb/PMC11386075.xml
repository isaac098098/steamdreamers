Unintended microbial growth can occur in these environments as in buildings on Earth from elevated moisture, such as from a temporary ventilation system failure. This growth can drive negative health outcomes and degrade building materials. We need a predictive approach for modeling microbial growth in these critical indoor spaces.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Here, we demonstrate that even short exposures to varying elevated relative humidity can facilitate rapid microbial growth and microbial community composition changes in dust from spacecraft. We modeled fungal growth in dust from the International Space Station using the time-of-wetness framework with activation and deactivation limited growth occurring at 85% and 100% relative humidity, respectively. Fungal concentrations ranged from an average of 4.4&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>6</sup> spore equivalents per milligram of dust in original dust with no exposure to relative humidity to up to 2.1&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10<sup>10</sup> when exposed to 100% relative humidity for 2&#160;weeks. As relative humidity and time-elevated increased, fungal diversity was significantly reduced for both alpha (<italic toggle="yes">Q</italic>&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05) and beta (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#8201;=&#8201;0.307, <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>&#8201;=&#8201;0.001) diversity metrics.

This will be fueled in part by the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA) Commercial Low-Earth Orbit Destination initiative that will support private companies such as Starlab Space, LLC, and Blue Origin to build and operate the next generation of space stations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, NASA&#8217;s <italic toggle="yes">Artemis</italic>&#160;missions will establish a lunar orbiting space station named Gateway, as well as a surface habitat, which will be the proving ground for technologies needed to live on Mars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One of the best analogs we have available to these future systems is the International Space Station (ISS).</p><p id="Par12">The ISS is a unique built environment that is an almost completely closed indoor system continuously inhabited for over 20&#160;years in low-Earth orbit. The ISS contains its own unique microbiome with over 12,000 species identified onboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], similar to indoor environments on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These microbes originate from the astronauts, their food, onboard experiments, and other sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Similar to Earth, many microbes reside in the dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">On Earth, indoor dust acts as a sink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] for microbes and a potential exposure source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] for occupants in the indoor environment. Dust is also generated onboard the ISS from the daily activities of the crew. The crew must use a vacuum to remove dust from the high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter coverings, which are a part of the air ventilation system, on a weekly basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The exposure risk for microbes in dust is not well understood in microgravity environments, but it differs from Earth due to the altered particle size distributions in the air and the absence of gravitational settling influences how they deposit in the lungs when inhaled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Exposure to fungal growth indoors is associated with negative health outcomes such as asthma and allergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Understanding indoor microbial exposure risks is especially critical in the extreme conditions experienced during spaceflight that compromise the human immune system, potentially exacerbating any negative health effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, the unique stressors of a spaceflight environment can cause changes in microbial communities such as increased virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Negative health impacts due to microbial exposure have impacted ISS crew members during flight with symptoms such as rhinitis, skin infections, urinary tract infections, and skin rashes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition to astronaut health, preventing microbial growth during spaceflight is important to maintain the structural integrity of the spacecraft as some microbes are able to degrade mission-critical spacecraft materials such as plastics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], sealants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] which can cause premature failure of spacecraft components. Microbial activity onboard has been known to cause issues in essential systems such as biofouling in water lines due to issues in the original design that has since been rectified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, capture of bacterial- and fungal-related airborne particles is a major function of the ISS air filtration system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Increased levels of relative humidity facilitate rapid microbial growth, especially for fungi. Elevated equilibrium relative humidity (ERH) in the air is sufficient to provide enough water availability to microbes to support growth in the dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which can be predicted even under varying relative humidity conditions using the time-of-wetness framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These elevated ERH conditions significantly alter community composition and change microbial function in terrestrial house dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. On the ISS, the current NASA operational guidelines for relative humidity is to maintain it between 25 and 75% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], but pockets of elevated moisture conditions are possible during the daily operations onboard. Examples include fungal growth on plant experiments onboard due to a ventilation failure that caused high ERH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], fungal growth on fabric panels where a wet towel was placed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] on various pieces of equipment used onboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and microbial growth on free-floating condensate on the Russian station <italic toggle="yes">Mir</italic>in an unused section of the station [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, we do not yet understand if we are able to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS as can be done on Earth.</p><p id="Par16">The goal of this project is to predict fungal growth in dust from the ISS under varying moisture conditions using the time-of-wetness framework. To our knowledge, this is the first study to actively grow a collection of microbes directly from a substrate that is onboard the ISS to model unexpected high moisture conditions. The results have important implications for protecting human health and spacecraft integrity during future missions to the moon, Mars, and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par17">Dust samples were obtained from four vacuum bags that came from weekly housekeeping activities to clean the protective screen covers for the HEPA filters which are part of the ISS air ventilation system. Samples were returned to Earth, where they were incubated at varying constant ERH conditions (50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, and 100%) for 2&#160;weeks. In addition, the time-of-wetness framework was used to model microbial growth at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used for the quantification of bacteria and fungi for all samples. Illumina MiSeq sequencing was used to determine how microbial communities in the ISS dust changed for each ERH and time-of-wetness condition. In addition, a subset of these samples was observed via scanning electron microscopy to visualize microbial growth directly on the ISS dust samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>ISS dust samples</title><p id="Par18">All dust used in this study was obtained from vacuum bags (CELOC hypo-allergenic filter system Oreck# PKBB12DW) from the vacuum onboard the ISS which the astronauts use to clean the HEPA filter coverings that are part of the air ventilation system. It is important to note that we had no control over when, how much, or where these vacuums were used while onboard, which means other areas may have also been vacuumed in addition to the HEPA filter coverings. In total, ISS dust from four separate vacuum bags was returned to Earth and analyzed in this study. ISS vacuum bags 1&#8211;4 were collected by the ISS crew on GMT 264 (September 21, 2018), GMT 102 (April 12, 2019), GMT 243 (August 31, 2019), and GMT 286 (October 13, 2019) and returned to Earth on SpaceX16 (January 13, 2019), SpaceX-17 (July 3, 2019), and SpaceX-19 (January 7, 2020). In total, it took approximately 6, 5, 6, and 4&#160;months for bags 1, 2, 3, and 4 to reach our lab at the Ohio State University from the actual collection date onboard ISS. For ISS vacuum bag 1, the full vacuum bag was sent directly to The Ohio State University Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory. ISS vacuum bags 2&#8211;4 were first sent to the Toxicology and Environmental Chemistry group at NASA&#8217;s Johnson Space Center (Houston, TX, USA), and then, a subsample of dust was sent to us for analysis. In addition, we received dust samples that were frozen onboard the ISS, returned in cold stowage, and sent directly to our laboratory, where they were stored at&#8201;&#8722;&#8201;80&#160;&#176;C until use (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Incubations</title><p id="Par19">All incubation was completed in a sterilized 3.8 L glass chamber and placed in a VWR incubator (Model TFFU20F2QWA Radnor, PA USA) set to 25&#160;&#176;C. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and magnesium chloride (MgCl<sub>2</sub>) solutions were used to simulate 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, and 90% ERH conditions. Deionized (DI) water alone was used to create 100% ERH conditions. Salt solutions were measured for water activity (<italic toggle="yes">a</italic><sub><italic toggle="yes">w</italic></sub>) using an Aqualab&#8482; Dew Point Water Activity Meter (Decagon 125 Devices Pullman, WA, USA) and adjusted as needed. All incubation chambers contained approximately 50&#160;mL of salt solution or DI for the desired ERH condition and an Onset&#174;&#160;HOBO&#174;&#160;Data logger (Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne, MA, USA) to monitor ERH and temperature. Dust samples were not sieved and measured out into approximately 25&#160;mg portions that were placed on sterile aluminum foil on a plastic dish. Two-week incubations consisted of triplicate samples for each ISS bag and ERH condition (three samples from each bag per incubation chamber) similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Time-of-wetness incubations followed a procedure previously outlined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Time-of-wetness refers to the time fraction per day when relative humidity conditions are above the 80% threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This framework was applied to microbial growth in ISS dust by calculating the relative growth rates at days 5, 10, 14, and 21 at elevated (85% ERH) and saturated (100% ERH) conditions which cycled between 50% ERH for 6, 12, 18, and 24&#160;h during separate incubations. To obtain the relative growth rate (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>), we first calculated the growth rates (<italic toggle="yes">k</italic>) for constant (24&#160;h/day) elevated and saturated conditions. Next, the effective growth rates (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic>) were calculated for each condition (elevated and saturated) at 6-, 12-, and 18-h time points. The relative growth rate was calculated for each bag at each time of wetness first, then these values were averaged to obtain the averaged maximum relative growth rate for each time point and ERH condition. Samples were extracted and quantified on days 5, 10, 14, and 21 after incubation (one 25-mg dust sample per day per bag).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to expose ISS dust to varying moisture conditions to show that increasing ERH alters microbial growth and community composition even for a short period of time. As mentioned above, NASA sets standards for ERH conditions onboard the ISS that ideally stay between 25 and 75% ERH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, due to the airflow present in the ISS ventilation system, pockets of isolated moisture can occur in certain spots around the station especially during certain activities. For example, astronauts are required to exercise for 2.5&#160;h daily to mitigate the many negative health impacts associated with long-duration spaceflight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] which creates excess moisture in the form of sweat. Personal hygiene is also a major source of potential elevated moisture exposure while showering, brushing teeth, or washing hands. Additionally, this moisture may originate from the crew dining area during meals or from unintended water release from several plant production systems onboard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In microgravity fluids such as water act differently compared to on Earth, such as capillary forces being more dominant on the ISS (microgravity) where Earth is governed by gravitational forces. Due to these many potential sources of daily elevated moisture conditions, it is critical to understand how fungal and bacterial communities in spacecraft dust will react when receiving ideal growth conditions, namely water availability, and how this can affect crew health, spacecraft integrity, and planetary protection plans.</p><p id="Par39">In ISS dust after 2&#160;weeks exposed to constant ERH conditions significant growth for fungi occurred at 80% RH, while for bacteria this occurred at 90% ERH compared to original dust samples (no ERH exposure). This is similar to previous studies that showed significant growth under similar conditions for fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes. The overall quantity of fungal growth is also comparable between these studies where house dust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and ISS dust could both reach more than 10<sup>9</sup>SE per milligram dust when exposed to 100% RH for 2&#160;weeks. The time-of-wetness framework has also been applied to growth in Earth-based house dust samples that can be compared to samples from ISS dust. Time-of-wetness samples showed a two-stage activation limited growth model for fungi for both elevated (85% RH) and saturated (100% RH) conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These results differ in contrast to the ISS dust where elevated RH fungi showed an activation-limited growth model and at saturated conditions showed a deactivation-limited growth model (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). There may be several potential reasons for this difference in fungal growth models for Earth and ISS built environments. Generally, every indoor environment has a different microbial dust composition. For future missions, especially beyond low-Earth orbit, understanding the microbes present and how they may grow will be essential to mitigate any potential negative impacts on crew health and safety due to microbial-related illness or material degradation.</p><p id="Par40">These results offer a path to improved prediction of fungal growth in specialized indoor spaces modeled on fluctuating ERH conditions. However, it is important to restate that these incubations were performed on Earth and not in environmental conditions experienced in low-Earth orbit such as microgravity, elevated CO<sub>2</sub>, and low-dose radiation, all of which may affect microbial growth and microbial composition. The results are also affected by the dust sampling protocol for returned vacuum bags, which were triple-sealed and stored at room temperature while awaiting return to Earth in which time microbial communities may have been altered. Given the difficulty of procuring spaceflight samples, we have a relatively small sample size (dust from four ISS vacuum bags), but this should be sufficient to provide valuable information. These limitations highlight the need for future on-orbit studies to better understand this microbiology during actual spaceflight conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">Our results provide important foundational knowledge for the prediction of fungal growth in future spacecraft, space stations, and surface habitats. The time-of-wetness framework, which utilizes varying ERH conditions, as shown in this study can be expanded and refined to incorporate other key environmental factors present in spaceflight. With the appropriate model based on time exposure to elevated relative humidity levels, we can predict how much and what type of microbial growth will be present in spacecraft dust during long-duration human space missions. We can continue to refine moisture control on spacecraft to preserve a healthy environment. As crewed commercial spacecraft and missions beyond low-Earth orbit become a reality, a better understanding of microbes onboard a spacecraft will protect human health and spacecraft integrity and aid in developing planetary protection protocols to prevent forward and/or backward microbial contamination of Earth and the other celestial bodies we will visit in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>
