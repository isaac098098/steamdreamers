<bold>Introduction:</bold> It may take decades to develop cardiovascular dysfunction following exposure to high doses of ionizing radiation from medical therapy or from nuclear accidents. Since astronauts may be exposed continually to a complex space radiation environment unlike that experienced on Earth, it is unresolved whether there is a risk to cardiovascular health during long-term space exploration missions. Previously, we have described that mice exposed to a single dose of simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR<sub>5-ion</sub>) develop cardiovascular dysfunction by 12&#160;months post-radiation.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> To investigate the biological basis of this dysfunction, here we performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from these mice at 8&#160;months post-radiation.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for irradiated versus sham irradiated samples (fold-change &#8805;1.2 and an adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value of &#8804;0.05) were identified for each proteomics data set. For the heart proteome, there were 87 significant DEPs (11 upregulated and 76 downregulated); for the heart phosphoproteome, there were 60 significant differentially phosphorylated peptides (17 upregulated and 43 downregulated); and for the plasma proteome, there was only one upregulated protein. A Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) technique that assesses canonical pathways from BIOCARTA, KEGG, PID, REACTOME, and WikiPathways revealed significant perturbation in pathways in each data set. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were significantly altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways significantly altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways significantly affected at 0.1 adjusted <italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value cutoff. Pathways related to inflammation were the most highly perturbed in the heart and plasma. In line with sustained inflammation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were demonstrated to be increased in GCR<sub>5-ion</sub> irradiated hearts at 12-month post irradiation. NETs play a fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens, modulating inflammatory responses, inflicting damage on healthy tissues, and escalating vascular thrombosis.</p><p>
<bold>Discussion:</bold> These findings suggest that a single exposure to GCR<sub>5-ion</sub> results in long-lasting changes in the proteome and that these proteomic changes can potentiate acute and chronic health issues for astronauts, such as what we have previously described with late cardiac dysfunction in these mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>galactic cosmic ray</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular degeneration</kwd><kwd>space radiation</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>ionizing radiation</kwd><kwd>cardiovascular disease</kwd><kwd>phosphoproteomics</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>This work is supported by NASA research grant NNX16AK20G to DB, Translational Research Institute though NASA cooperative agreement NNX16AK20G to DB, and NASA research grant NSSC22K0253 to DB.

Physiologically, this dysfunction was manifested as changes in arterial elastance, and histologically, there was evidence of elastin fragmentation in the aorta. Of the protein markers we evaluated (Fibulin-4, Fibulin-5, TGF-beta1, and EGFR), EGFR was the only marker that showed a statistically significant decrease in hearts from GCR-irradiated animals compared to age-matched sham irradiated controls (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bishawi et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Other investigations have also examined the levels of individual cardiac protein markers in studies where rodents or rabbits were exposed to components of GCR (reviewed in <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Seawright et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Soucy et al., 2011</xref>). These studies have indicated that a number of proteins and pathways and biological functions are permanently affected in the heart from a single exposure of space relevant radiation. Seawright et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Seawright et al., 2019</xref>) noted an increase in a 75&#160;kDa peptide of collagen type III in the left ventricle of rats exposed to protons (250&#160;MeV) and <sup>16</sup>O (600 MeV/n and 1 GeV/n), suggesting that these components of GCR caused remodeling of existing collagens in the heart. Also noted in this study were increases in the amounts of CD2, CD68, and CD45 proteins at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 9 months after exposure to protons or <sup>16</sup>O alone, suggesting immune cell infiltration. In a rabbit model, hearts exposed to 15&#160;Gy of targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR) exhibited a significant upregulation of connexin 43 (Cx43) protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2&#160;weeks out to 1&#160;year after a single exposure (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Amino et al., 2010</xref>). Cx43, the major connexin in cardiac gap junction, plays an essential role in the synchronized contraction of the heart and perturbations in Cx43 levels could profoundly influence cardiac function.</p><p>Soucy et al. examined xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in the aortas of rats exposed to whole-body exposure of iron ion radiation (<sup>56</sup>Fe-ion) at doses of 0, 0.5, or 1&#160;Gy (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Soucy et al., 2011</xref>). <italic toggle="yes">In vivo</italic> aortic stiffness and <italic toggle="yes">ex vivo</italic> aortic tension responses were measured 6 and 8 months after exposure as indicators of chronic vascular injury. Rats exposed to 1&#160;Gy <sup>56</sup>Fe-ion demonstrated significantly increased aortic stiffness, as measured by pulse wave velocity. XO activity was significantly elevated in rat aorta 4 months after whole-body irradiation.</p><p>Recently, Azimzadeh et al. published a comprehensive review of the available omics data (proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, and multi-omics) of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease focusing on gamma and X-ray exposure (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh et al., 2022</xref>). Across 27 published proteomics data sets, mitochondrial proteins were the most sensitive protein cluster affected in irradiated hearts across different types and doses of radiation, with many of these mitochondrial proteins being significantly downregulated. In addition, long term downregulation of many anti-oxidant defense proteins was observed in many publication examining mouse models as well as validated in studies of heart autopsies obtained from workers in the nuclear industry.</p><p>While recently <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Laiakis et al (2022)</xref> have utilized label-free mass spectrometry untargeted quantitative proteomic profiling to characterize the proteome of the prefrontal cortex in rats exposed to <sup>28</sup>Si ions, there have been no corresponding studies undertaken to understand the global proteomic changes occurring in the heart following exposure to components of space radiation. As the proteome can provide a better understanding of the structure and the function of the organism than genomics, we have performed a quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis of heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice exposed to GCR<sub>5-ion</sub>. Integration of these three omics data sets has enabled a more comprehensive understanding of the systemic impact of GCR<sub>5-ion</sub> and suggests that sustained inflammatory response with neutrophil extracellular trap formation is one of the major pathways driving the biological responses to space radiation in the heart.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The overall experimental design is provided in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1" orientation="portrait"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Overview of sample preparation, processing, and bioinformatics analysis pipeline.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" position="float" orientation="portrait" xlink:href="fphys-15-1248276-g001.jpg"/></fig><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experimental animals</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Duke University and Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs).

Default settings were used except for the following: no variable modifications and semitryptic peptide N-termini specificity. DIA files were converted to *.htrms format using a HTRMS converter (Biognosys). Default quantification settings were used except that the workflow used indexed retention time profiling of non-identified precursors; options to carryover peak boundaries and unify peptides were selected. For statistical analysis, single hit proteins were excluded, and quantification was performed at MS2 level using summed precursor areas for the top 20 peptides, Q-value percentile (0.3), and cross-run normalization using q-value complete and median global normalization settings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Data filtering</title><p>Twenty-two human keratin proteins were excluded from the heart dataset as they were suspected to be contaminants.

Each data set was analyzed using a bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach, as outlined in the Materials and Methods, to map these changes to cellular location, protein function, and biological pathways. For the heart proteome, 166 pathways were altered (36 upregulated and 130 downregulated); for the plasma proteome, there were 73 pathways altered (25 upregulated and 48 downregulated); and for the phosphoproteome, there were 223 pathways affected at 0.1 FDR cutoff. See <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table S4&#8211;S8</xref> for details on all pathways emerging from the bioinformatics/gene functional-enrichment approach.

Major enriched pathways that were downregulated in the heart proteome were: cell cycle/transcription (CCTR), HIV life cycle, iron uptake and transport, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, insulin glucose pathways, mitochondrial functions (including oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport system), and keratinization/cornification (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>).

There is relatively little knowledge regarding the time frame to develop cardiovascular disease from exposure to the space radiation environment. Here, we undertook a multi-proteomics approach to characterize protein and pathway perturbations that occurred in hearts and plasma from mice exposed to a single dose of GCR<sub>5-ion</sub> 8 months prior.</p><p>One of the most interesting observations was that across the three data sets, the abundance of the majority of the DEPs diminished in the heart and plasma at 8 months post radiation. While one acute effect of radiation is to cause fragmentation and aggregation of protein molecules (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Kumta and Tappel, 1961</xref>), it is possible that the effects observed at 8 months post radiation may be due to the inhibition of protein synthesis. We previously reported that microgravity, another stressor of space travel, reduced protein turnover in cardiomyocytes (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Feger et al., 2016</xref>) and speculated that this diminishment in protein synthesis could lead to overall reduction in cardiomyocyte protein content.</p><p>Calmodulin 2 (CALM2), a signaling protein involved in the calcium-regulated contraction of cardiac muscle (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Beghi et al., 2022</xref>), was one of the most highly perturbed proteins in the heart proteome in this study. We examined the expression levels of CALM2 as well as an associated kinase (CAMKG2) via Western blots but did not see a statistical difference in abundance of either protein in the hearts of GCR<sub>5-ion</sub> irradiated mice compared to unirradiated controls (<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures S2A, S3C</xref>). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were also performed on hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice to validate markers of complement activation (C4d and C4b-BP; <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>) and coagulation/clotting/fibrin formation (fibrinogen alpha, fibrinogen beta, fibrinogen gamma; <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figures S2C, S3</xref>). From this analysis, only fibrinogen gamma was statistically significantly different between hearts from irradiated and sham irradiated mice as observed via Western blot analysis (<xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S2H</xref>).</p><p>In the plasma proteome, the most significantly regulated protein was major urinary protein 20 (MUP20) which was upregulated in irradiated animals. MUP20 is a male pheromone which promotes aggressive male behavior, stimulates female sexual attraction to male urinary scent, promotes a strong learned attraction to the airborne urinary odor of an individual male, and promotes spatial learning by rapidly conditioning preference for its remembered location among females and competitor males so that animals prefer to spend time in the site even when scent is absent (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Demir et al., 2020</xref>). While this finding may not be translatable since humans are the only placental mammals found not to have any active MUP genes (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Logan et al., 2008</xref>), the finding of MUP20 dysregulation in male mice exposed to GCR<sub>5-ion</sub> may illuminate behavioral and learning changes following exposures of rodents to various GCR components.</p><p>Other proteins dysregulated in the plasma following GCR irradiation are serum amyloid A1 (SAA1) (upregulated) and glutathione S-transferase theta-3 (GSTT3) (downregulated). SAA1 is a major acute-phase protein mainly produced by hepatocytes in response to infection, tissue injury, and malignancy. SAA has anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting platelet aggregation and by reducing the oxidative burst in Polymorphonuclear neutrophils(<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Zimlichman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Gatt et al., 1998</xref>). SAA also has proinflammatory effects, such as induction of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes, allowing the repair of tissue damage and inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1B, IL-6, and TNFa (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Uhlar and Whitehead, 1999</xref>). GSTT3 is expressed strongly in the liver (and to a lesser extent in kidney and testis). Glutathione transferases play a significant role in the metabolism/detoxification process of a wide range of electrophilic compounds that include mutagens, carcinogens, reactive oxygen species, and some therapeutic agents.</p><p>The most highly impacted pathways in the heart tissue were inflammation/complement/coagulation, mitochondria, and cell cycle/transcription (CCTR). The downregulation of the mitochondrial pathways is in line with the comprehensive Azimzadeh et al. review of omics data from radiation induced-cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Azimzadeh et al., 2022</xref>). However, in our study, the CCTR cluster was the most highly affected, as detailed in <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>, which shows the 72 CCTR processes that are downregulated in the heart 8 months post GCR irradiation. This global downregulation in cell cycle and transcription processes may help explain the overall diminishment in protein abundance noted earlier in the discussion.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting finding from this study involves neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs have come to the forefront of immunology for their fundamental role in combating bacterial pathogens. Beyond this defensive capacity, intriguingly, NETs have shown the ability to modulate inflammatory responses, even within sterile environments (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Papayannopoulos, 2018</xref>).</p><p>One remarkable illustration of this involves the role of cholesterol crystals in prompting the formation of NETs, which subsequently stimulate macrophages to unleash IL-1-beta, a process known to expedite the development of atherosclerosis (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Warnatsch et al., 2015</xref>). This process becomes particularly concerning when a plaque rupture transpires. The resulting exposure of endovascular NETs can escalate vascular thrombosis, a factor intimately tied to severe cardiovascular events like acute myocardial infarction and stroke (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Klopf et al., 2021</xref>). Our study has unveiled some illuminating findings in this area. Employing proteomic analysis, we discovered that the NETs formation pathway was activated in mice exposed to Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), and myocardium sections exhibited a significant accumulation of NETs in these mice after long-term high-energy GCR exposure.</p><p>Our findings align with previous research wherein, in a mouse bladder cancer model receiving radiation therapy, NETs were found to promote their formation through the protein HMGB1 via a TLR4-dependent pathway both <italic toggle="yes">in vitro</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Shinde-Jadhav et al., 2021</xref>). Notably, the accumulation of NETs and its components in local areas can inflict damage on healthy tissues. Prior research has linked the increased expression of NETs in the inflamed myocardium to gene expression of collagen type I (Col1a1) and increased the heart stiffness in mouse models (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2019</xref>). This correlation may explain our previous findings, which demonstrated decreased systolic heart function and increased arterial elastance 1&#160;year after GCR exposure, as revealed through cardiac-pressure-volume loop analysis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Bishawi et al., 2022</xref>). From our limited tissue samples, we observed an increased presence of type I collagen in the GCR-exposed mice, but no significant difference in type III collagen between the two groups (see <xref rid="s11" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Evidence for persistent activity, as indicated by markers such as MPO and elastase, was noted 8 months post-exposure. However, this study did not include additional markers such as plasma enrichment, quantification of NETotic neutrophils, cleaved caspases, and condensed nuclei, which could have provided further insights into the sustained nature of NETs activity. The findings underscore the need for a more comprehensive investigation with an expanded sample size, controlled left ventricular mass data, and methodical sampling at regular intervals throughout the study to evaluate this phenomenon more accurately. NETs have also been shown to promote the development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mouse models (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Brill et al., 2012</xref>). A complication associated with cardiovascular degeneration during space flight that was recently brought to light is the occurrence of venous thromboembolisms (VTEs). Approximately 2 months into a mission aboard the International Space Station in 2019, a female astronaut noticed an abnormality during an ultrasound examination (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Au&#241;&#243;n-Chancellor et al., 2020</xref>). Upon further examination and consultation with physicians on Earth, the astronaut was diagnosed with a left internal jugular venous thrombosis. The astronaut presented with no signs or symptoms, and she had no family or personal history of venous thromboembolisms. A therapeutic regimen was quickly established for the astronaut and she was luckily treated in a timely manner. This incidence exemplifies the unknown health consequences associated with unique stressors of the space environment. Although there are other confounding factors that may have contributed to the astronaut&#8217;s hypercoagulable state, there is evidence that her exposure to space radiation was a primary constituent.</p><p>We found NETs presentation in the myocardium, but no significant enrichment of inflammatory cytokines was identified in the plasma. Neutrophils serve as the first-line of innate immunity. The cytokines that trigger NETs formation might be detectable during the acute injury stage. Thus, there is a pressing need for another study that collects samples shortly after GCR exposure to accurately determine what triggers NETs.</p><p>While the exact mechanism behind NET formation following GCR exposure remains elusive in our study and whether NET formation may have played a role in the astronaut&#8217;s development of VTE is unknown, we propose a hypothesis involving chronic tissue damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) activation post-radiation exposure as potential mechanisms, warranting further investigation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank members of the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), Peter Guida PhD, Adam Rusek PhD, James Jardine, Paula Bennet, Michael Sievert PhD, and Deborah Snyder.
