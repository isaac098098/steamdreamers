Integrated &#8220;omics&#8221; analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) of wild type (WT), single and multiple <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO lines were conducted. Transcriptome and proteome data were collapsed into gene ortholog (GO) data, with this allowing for enzymatic reaction and metabolome cross-comparisons to uncover dominant or likely metabolic biosynthesis reactions affected. Network analysis of enzymes&#8211;highly correlated to stem lignin levels&#8211;deduced the involvement of novel putative lignin related proteins or processes. These included those associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. While prior work helped explain lignin biosynthesis regulation at the transcriptional level, our data here provide support for a new hypothesis that there are additional post-transcriptional and translational level processes that need to be considered. These findings are anticipated to lead to development of more accurate depictions of lignin/phenylpropanoid biosynthesis models <italic toggle="yes">in situ</italic>, with new protein targets identified for further biochemical analysis and/or plant bioengineering.

For stem tissues, a Polytron homogenizer was used for about 30 s at a speed of 30 to further homogenize them.

The above addition of ammonium acetate/methanol solution and centrifugation steps were repeated four more times to remove metabolites and lipids from each sample. Excess methanol was removed by drying the pellets gently under a flow of nitrogen for &#8764;2 min. A protein solubilization solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% CHAPS and 5 mM of neutralized tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) (Bond-Breaker, Thermo Fisher, San Jose, CA, United States) was added to each sample to completely cover each pellet, plus 500 &#956;L more.

Each sample loaded onto the C18 column was washed for 15 min with Solvent A [10 mM ammonium formate, adjusted to pH 10 with ammonium hydroxide (14.8 M)]. The gradient started with a linear increase of 0% Solvent B [10 mM ammonium formate, pH 10, acetonitrile:water (90:10 v/v)] to: 5% Solvent B over 10 min, 45% Solvent B over 65 min, and then to 100% Solvent B over 15 min. Solvent B was held at 100% for 10 min, and then this was changed to 100% Solvent A, this being held for 20 min to recondition the column. The flow rate was 0.5 mL min<sup>&#8211;1</sup>. A total of 48 fractions were collected for each sample into a 96 well plate throughout the above LC gradient. The high pH RP fractions were then combined into 12 fractions using the concatenation strategy previously reported (<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).

Full automation was made possible by custom software that allows for parallel event coordination and therefore near 100% MS duty cycle through use of two trapping and analytical columns.

Sample injections (5 &#956;L) were trapped and washed on the trapping columns at 3 &#956;L min<sup>&#8211;1</sup> for 20 min prior to alignment with analytical columns. Data acquisition lagged the gradient start and end times by 15 min to account for column dead volume that allowed for the tightest overlap possible in a two-column operation. The two-column operation also allowed for columns to be &#8220;washed&#8221; (shortened gradients) and re-generated off-line without any cost to duty cycle.</p><p>The LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent mode acquiring higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) scans (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 7,500, 5 &#215; 104 target ions) after each full MS scan (<italic toggle="yes">R</italic> = 30,000, 3 &#215; 106 target ions) for the top ten most abundant ions within the mass range of 300 to 1,800 <italic toggle="yes">m/z</italic>.

Individual peptide intensity values were determined by dividing the base peak intensity by the relative ratio associated with each reporter ion. Each iTRAQ experiment references a pool of peptides so that all experiments could be linked. All peptide data were combined into a single data table and were transformed to a log<sub>2</sub> value, following which each data row of each iTRAQ experiment was shifted so that the reference pool value in each iTRAQ experiment was equal. Then each column of data representing each channel of each iTRAQ experiment was mean centered. All peptide values were next transformed to undo the log<sub>2</sub>, by calculating 2 to the power of each data point. Peptide abundance values were then separated into two datasets, one of peptides unique to a single protein and peptides which are shared between two or more proteins. Peptides were rolled up to a protein value by summing the peptides that belong to each protein in each dataset. Where the same protein was calculated in both datasets, only one protein value was selected in a final protein rollup table with the protein value from the unique peptide rollup given preference if identified in all channels. Individual protein roll-up calculations from the unique or shared peptide table were designated in the final protein roll-up table. KEGG Orthology protein family groups (KEGOs) were also determined for both protein and transcript data. Protein KEGOs were calculated by summing all unique peptide values found within a KEGO. Transcript KEGOs were calculated by summing all transcript count data within a like KEGO. All protein, transcript and KEGO values were converted to a log<sub>2</sub> value. Log<sub>2</sub> values below 2 in all protein datasets were removed as these primarily represent noise signals which interfere with <italic toggle="yes">z</italic>-score calculations. All replicates were averaged, and MA plots were constructed for each comparison between the average value of each WT and mutant line. All fold change pairs analyzed in MA plots, were combined into a single dataset and the values obtained in the A axis were ranked from lowest to highest.

Known interactions from either curated databases or which were experimentally determined were considered, along with predicted interactions from gene fusion, gene co-occurrence, gene neighborhood experiments, as well as from text mining, co-expression datasets and protein homology datasets. Node interactions were selected only if STRING returned a minimum interaction score of 0.4 or higher and for nodes with at least one interaction.

For both tissue types, full RNA-Seq transcriptomics, iTRAQ 8-plex multiplexing proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS, together with primary (GC-MS) and secondary (LC-MS) metabolomics analyses were performed.

The general rationale for this approach relied on the assumption that variance is similar for biomolecules of similar abundances. Transcript or peptide measurements with similar abundances can therefore act as pseudo-replicates producing similar distribution parameters. This strategy is commonly utilized for expression data and with various bioinformatics tools [e.g., SAM (<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tusher et al., 2001</xref>), limma (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>), and VAMPIRE (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hsiao et al., 2005</xref>)].</p><p>We applied this approach to log<sub>2</sub> fold change transcriptome, proteome and metabolome data between each <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutant and WT analysis.

Glycolic acid is produced when ribulose bisphosphate (RuBisCo) fixes O<sub>2</sub> instead of CO<sub>2</sub>.

Nine glucosinolates, which are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing metabolites synthesized by plants as defense against herbivory and pathogens, were also identified. Glucosinolates derived from homomethione (i.e., glucoiberin, glucohirsutin, 7-methylsulfinylheptylglucosinolate, and glucohesperalin) generally decreased in abundance in the <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants compared to WT, whereas those derived from Trp or Phe showed mixed abundance changes depending on the <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutant and tissue type. Glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin and 1-methoxyglucobrassicin, all derived from Trp, showed increases and decreases depending on the specific <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutant analyzed. 4-Methoxyglucobrassicin (Trp derived) increased in abundance in most <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants leaf samples, and in most of the double/triple/quadruple <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants as well as in <italic toggle="yes">adt5</italic>.

Our findings that <italic toggle="yes">ADT3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ADT4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic> were highest in abundance in 4 week old stems was corroborated by similar findings of RT-PCR levels found in 5 week old <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> stem tissues (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Corea et al., 2012c</xref>) and separate Northern blot analyses (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Rippert et al., 2009</xref>) in 4 week old WT <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>. The latter showed that <italic toggle="yes">ADT4</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic> were highest in abundance in stem and root tissues.</p><p>RNA-Seq data also indicated an increase in <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> expression between <italic toggle="yes">ADT3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ADT4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic>, when one of the <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic>s in that subgroup was knocked-out. Large increases of <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic> were observed in the stems when <italic toggle="yes">ADT3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">ADT4</italic> were knocked out, showing &#8764;2 fold and &#8764;4 fold increases in the <italic toggle="yes">adt3</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">adt4</italic> knockout lines, respectively. When <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic> was knocked out, <italic toggle="yes">ADT4</italic> was expressed in greater amounts (&#8764;2 fold increase). Overall, these data showed that, especially in stem tissue, <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> mRNA expression between <italic toggle="yes">ADT3</italic>, <italic toggle="yes">ADT4</italic>, and <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic> seemed to be coordinated, as remaining <italic toggle="yes">ADTs</italic> in the <italic toggle="yes">ADT3/ADT4/ADT5</italic> subgroup increased when other subgroup members were knocked out. In leaf tissue, only modest effects were observed within this subgroup.</p><p>To view coverage and relative amounts (i.e., counts) of mRNA fragments identified in each RNA-Seq analysis (in reference to each <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> in leaves or stems), location of the various T-DNA insertions used to produce the KOs and peptides identified from the proteomics analysis, gene product data for each gene were illustrated side by side. The IGV Browser (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Thorvaldsd&#243;ttir et al., 2013</xref>) was used to map out reads to the gene, and using a PNNL developed script<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="footnote9">9</xref></sup>, the peptide data were converted into BED files which could then be used by any genome viewer software. This allowed visualization of proteomics data in relation to the gene alongside the RNA-Seq data.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 5</xref> displays an example of gene-transcript-peptide visualization comparisons detected in WT and <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO lines for <italic toggle="yes">ADT5</italic>. Comparisons of all other <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic>s in all RNA-Seq and proteomics data can be accessed at the MassIVE and ProteomeXchange data repository sites (Accession numbers <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="MSV000081518">MSV000081518</ext-link> and <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="PXD007701">PXD007701</ext-link>, respectively). Read sequences downstream of transcription from T-DNA insertions displayed vastly decreased levels as expected. The proteomics data also showed that few peptides from ADTs were identifiable in the high throughput analysis here, which indicated that the ADTs were likely low in abundance relative to the entire proteome in the leaves. By contrast, in stem tissues, more ADT transcripts and peptides were generally identifiable, supporting the hypothesis that <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> genes, as well as proteins, were relatively higher in abundance in stem tissues compared to leaves. This is likely due to stem tissues needing to biosynthesize lignin in greater relative amounts compared to leaves.</p><p>We next examined what proportion of each KEGG functional category, on average, contained the most significantly (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) changed proteins and transcripts in both leaf and stem tissues in all <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). Categories with the greatest proportion of significantly changed proteins/transcripts were involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis, &#945;-linolenic acid metabolism, nitrogen, carotenoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as aromatic amino acid metabolism. These findings are in high agreement with the significant changes observed in the metabolomics data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">3</xref>).</p><p>Protein and transcript analyses of the putative carotenoid biosynthesis pathway showed a high degree of significantly changed (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) protein/transcript members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>) when <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> content was reduced. Metabolite measurements of putative carotenoids also showed an almost universal increase in abundance in all <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO lines in both leaves and stems (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Carotenoids function in plants as accessory pigments in plastid membranes and in chloroplasts they are thought to contribute to energy dissipation and can act as protective agents against reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Nisar et al., 2015</xref>). Carotenoids and their cleavage apocarotenoid products, which may also serve as signaling molecules, are important in assembly of photosynthesis and antenna proteins for photosynthesis and photoprotection (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Cazzonelli and Pogson, 2010</xref>). Protein analysis of photosynthesis and antenna protein biosynthesis pathways showed a relatively high proportion of significantly changed proteins (<italic toggle="yes">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 6A</xref>) in <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants suggesting that knocking out <italic toggle="yes">ADTs</italic> in plants also affects photosynthesis.</p><p>While increases in the proportion of significantly changed proteins were observed in photosynthesis and carbon fixation pathways, especially in stems, such large changes were not seen at the corresponding transcript level. The fact that mRNA pools related to photosynthesis and carbon fixation were not changed much, whereas translation copy numbers were largely increased, raises the possibility of a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Other categories which were markedly different between protein and transcript data included those involved in Phe metabolism, and glycolate/decarboxylate metabolism. These were found to be highly changed in the protein data, especially in stem tissues, but less so at the transcript level. Categories that showed relatively high changes at the transcript level, but did not seem to translate to higher changes at the protein level, included those pathways involved in alanine/aspartate/glutamate, propanoate, and galactose metabolism, respectively. This was not surprising given that ADTs biosynthesize Phe.</p><p>We also observed that shikimate-chorismate derived metabolism pathways (i.e., to Phe, Tyr, and tryptophan) were highly changed at both transcript and protein levels. It is known that Phe, Tyr, and Trp produced via the shikimate-chorismate pathway contribute to feedback inhibition mechanisms of various shikimate pathway enzymes upstream of ADT (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Tzin and Galili, 2010</xref>), and that <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KOs can alter not only Phe levels but also levels of Tyr and Trp (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Corea et al., 2012a</xref>). We thus hypothesize that in <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants there likely may be alterations in the levels of other metabolites synthesized from Phe/Tyr/Trp precursors. These could potentially affect metabolites including phytohormones, which could, in turn, produce system-wide effects. For instance, phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is synthesized from Trp, and IAA can affect changes in growth, development and metabolism (<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">Zhao, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Another phytohormone potentially altered in <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants may be jasmonic acid (JA). While we did not specifically detect JA or any other phytohormone in the untargeted metabolomics data, changes in JA precursors may be indicative of potential changes in the downstream phytohormone levels. JA is derived from &#945;-linolenic acid (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Weber, 2002</xref>) and &#945;-linolenic acid metabolism pathways were highly changed at both the transcript and protein level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S8">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>). &#945;-Linolenic acid is not only a precursor to JA, but also aids in photosynthetic thylakoid membrane fluidity (<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">Yashroy, 1987</xref>) potentially acting as another contributor to alterations affecting photosynthesis. Other studies indicated that JA levels have a strong relationship to lignin levels. <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Denness et al. (2011)</xref> showed that both JA-isoleucine production and ROS production could form a negative feedback loop which can then repress each other&#8217;s production and influence lignin accumulation. Given there were lower levels of ascorbate and dehydroascorbate levels in the metabolomes derived from both leaf and stem tissue of <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants compared with WT, it may be that ROS is higher in concentration in <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutants given that there is less ascorbate to scavenge ROS. This along with altered levels of JA could potentially be contributing signals affecting lignin biosynthesis. Ascorbate is also a cofactor for biosynthesis of several other phytohormones, such as ethylene, gibberellins, and abscisic acid (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Pastori et al., 2003</xref>). Due to the potential for all these various phytohormones to be altered in amounts when <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> is knocked out, we hypothesize this may be why we see multiple pathway enzymes and metabolite levels affected and not just those directly upstream or downstream of <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S3.SS4"><title>Integrated Metabolome, Proteome, and Transcriptome Analysis</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref> shows Pearson&#8217;s Pairwise log<sub>2</sub> abundance dataset correlations between each WT and <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutant, as compared to every other <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> KO mutant between both proteins and transcripts at the gene product (protein or transcript) and KEGG ortholog (KEGO) enzyme family levels.

Interestingly, for the protein KEGO data, where a given reaction type showed highest proportion of the most abundant KEGOs, it then had the least proportion of highest correlations between protein and metabolite abundances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4B,C</xref>). When comparing protein KEGO and metabolite abundance changes, we also observed that the most highly abundant KEGOs were not usually the most correlated with detected metabolite level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), i.e., most abundant enzymes did not necessarily produce the most metabolite. Given that metabolite abundances are determined by multiple factors not represented by enzyme abundance alone (i.e., enzyme kinetics, differential degradation rates, and post-translational de/activation of enzymes), this observation is not surprising. Indeed, we can generalize that only &#8764;45&#8211;50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) of the most abundant KEGOs produced metabolite levels that were most highly correlated to KEGO abundances.

Venn diagrams which depict the overlap between proteins and transcripts revealed that (a) most transcripts detected did not correspond to a detectable protein, likely due to dynamic range and sampling limits of the proteomics technology compared to the depth of coverage capable with RNA-Seq and (b) not all proteins detected corresponded to a detectable transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) as could arise from differential mRNA and protein degradation rates. Lack of high correlations though between transcripts and proteins have been found to be typical. In many multi-omics evaluations, across eukaryotic and prokaryotic systems, transcripts and proteins are only modestly correlated (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Foss et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Ghazalpour et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Battle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Chick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hasin et al., 2017</xref>). Two examples from plant and animal organisms highlight this point. In a multi-omics investigation of maize, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Walley et al. (2016)</xref> observed that transcriptome and proteome abundance profiles showed little overlap. In a comparable study of human disease, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Hasin et al. (2017)</xref> found that transcript levels often exhibited a poor correlation with protein levels, although it was considered that the proteomics data alone was more proximal to the disease mechanisms.</p><p>Furthermore, metabolite levels did not show a dominant correlation with either transcripts or proteins. These data illustrate the limitations in using only a single omics evaluation to make systems level biological assessments. Comparisons between these omics datasets may thus reveal (a) what transcripts are actually translated and in what copy number, and (b) what metabolomics data help reveal which proteins or protein families are more or less active in producing the observed metabolites. The integrated &#8220;omics&#8221; analysis, as presented here, provides over-arching and molecule specific information, which is useful for understanding general molecular pathway trends, and for identifying targets of interest for bioengineering purposes or for follow-on analyses.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS2"><title>Network Analysis Reveals Lignin/Phenylpropanoid Biosynthesis Associated Proteins</title><p>Network analysis is a powerful tool for understanding systems biology effects, drawing from known and predicted direct (physical) and indirect (functional) interactions from multiple data and literature sources. Such analyses can utilize enzyme relationships derived from hundreds of sources (e.g., yeast two hybrid, co-localization, co-expression, literature text mining, etc.). In turn, this can help provide new insights into interconnections and significant relationships of proteins with known and as-of-yet unknown function. Since our main focus was on proteins potentially related to altered lignin levels (as determined by thioacidolysis analysis), we selected those with greatest positive and negative correlative trends to lignin amounts present in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> stems of each line.</p><p>Centrally located in the lignin correlated protein network data created (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5A,B</xref>) were eleven ribosomal subunits that correlated with reduced lignin levels. This raised the possibility that lignin levels may be in part regulated by a ribosome filter or &#8220;ribocode&#8221; (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Mauro and Edelman, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">Xue and Barna, 2012</xref>). That is, lignin biosynthesis regulation may be associated with presence of specific ribosomal subunits involved in translation of lignin-biosynthesis-associated mRNA.</p><p>Recent studies have documented evidence for ribocodes, the concept of which suggests differential, temporal and spatial presence of specific ribosomal subunits which preferentially translate specific mRNAs, thus representing regulation at translation. Other observations of possible plant ribocodes include phosphate and Fe-deficiency studies by <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Rodr&#237;guez-Celma et al. (2013)</xref> and <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2013)</xref>, who both showed evidence for remodeled translational machinery in response to environmental signals in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>. <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al. (2012)</xref> also reported that translational control was mRNA abundance independent, concluding that mRNA levels had less effect on gene activity than translational control mechanisms in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>Other potential targets of lignin biosynthesis regulation identified included those associated with purine metabolism, the spliceosome, RNA degradation, mRNA surveillance and general mRNA processing proteins. Post-translational modifications, protein transport, and targeting mechanisms also appeared correlated with varying lignin levels. Additionally, post-translational related protein processing involving the endoplasmic reticulum was identified, as well as ubiquitin proteolysis, phosphorylation, autophosphorylation, and phosphatase proteins which may be connected to important processes related to lignin biosynthesis.</p><p>In our analysis as to what connects the spliceosome, which edits native mRNA into mature translatable mRNA and the ribosomal subunits, was the spliceosome protein DRH1 (At3g01540) to the large ribosomal subunit RPL2.1 (ATCG00830) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>). DRH1 is a ATP/dATP-dependent RNA helicase and polynucleotide-dependent ATPase (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Okanami et al., 1998</xref>). Export of poly(A)(+) RNA has been shown to be greatly blocked in DRH1 mutants (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2016</xref>). Presence or absence of this helicase could thus serve as a level of regulation, blocking or allowing export of mRNA into the cytosol.</p><p>Connected to the identified spliceosome proteins was SAP18 (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Song and Galbraith, 2006</xref>). In plants, this functions as a transcriptional repressor and associates with ethylene-responsive element binding factors to create a hormone-sensitive multimeric repressor complex under conditions of stress. A SAP18 loss of function mutant produces a plant both more susceptible to salt and impaired in chlorophyll synthesis.</p><p>These data indicate what we generally observed with our multi-omics data, namely that: (a) despite any significant presence of mRNA, there are additional factors which may prevent proper processing of mRNA into mature translatable form; (b) there are also other factors which may prevent any mRNA present from ever leaving the nucleus to be translated.</p><p>Together, these data also highlight the importance of proteomics to illuminate what protein products are actually present and which are potentially functional.</p><p>Furthermore, the vast majority of lignin biosynthesis regulation research thus far has focused on genes and transcriptional control (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Nakano et al., 2015</xref>). From this body of knowledge, we know that lignin biosynthesis is influenced by a series of transcription factors, such as NAC master switches, which can activate or repress an array of other downstream transcription factors (e.g., MYBs). What is lesser known are what additional post-transcriptional controls of lignin or other phenylpropanoids exist. Due to our discovery that modulating ADTs produces differential lignin contents in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>, the opportunity was presented where&#8211;through this multi-omics study&#8211;we could investigate molecular profiles with step-wise decreases or increases in lockstep to varying lignin levels. These results of our investigation suggest that there are potentially multiple processes, phytohormones and layers of regulation involved in lignin biosynthesis or in response to decreased carbon flux through the phenylpropanoid pathway.</p><p>Since this study was focused on correlations specific to lignin deposition, most attention was paid to correlative levels found in stems, although other phenylpropanoid-derived biomolecules and other pathways were also affected by <italic toggle="yes">ADT</italic> composition changes in leaves. It may be an interesting and informative exercise to further explore correlative enzyme abundances to other phenylpropanoids that may play a more central role in leaf tissue function. For example, those associated with UV protection (e.g., flavonoids and sinapate esters) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Stapleton and Walbot, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Landry et al., 1995</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Mazza et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Cl&#233; et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Sullivan et al., 2014</xref>), in order to tease out specific post-transcriptional biosynthesis regulation of formation of these other phenylpropanoids.</p><p>Ultimately, the multi-omics investigation and network analysis presented here proved invaluable for understanding systems level changes that modulated ADTs evoke in a model vascular plant. Importantly, it highlighted potentially new levels of post-transcriptional regulation of lignin/phenylpropanoids that can provisionally serve as biomolecular targets for follow-on analyses and/or for bioengineering purposes, i.e., aimed at modulating or modeling lignin/phenylpropanoids in vascular plants. These proteins can thus be used in follow-on lignin-associated enzyme validation studies and/or can potentially serve as truly novel bioengineering targets for manipulation of lignin/phenylpropanoid levels in vascular plants.</p></sec><sec id="S4.SS3"><title>Potential of a Lignin Regulating &#8220;Ribocode&#8221;</title><p>Ribosomes are the effectors in the final steps of gene expression, and it has emerged recently that ribosomes themselves could contribute to regulation via differential ribosomal subunit abundance. Evidence recently has also shown that according to developmental, environmental and pathological conditions, cells can produce different populations of ribosomes which differ in their ribosomal protein and RNA composition. These &#8220;specialized ribosomes&#8221; suggest that the unique ribosomal composition determines the translational activity of the ribosome and thus controls the biosynthesis of specific proteins and enzymes. For many years, ribosomes were thought to consist of a set number of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and rRNAs, with each RP present as a single copy with resulting conserved stoichiometry and homogeneity. One of the first indications that different types of ribosomes existed was from the study of RP paralogs in plants. In work done by <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Williams and Sussex (1995)</xref>, it was found that RPL16 paralog gene expression patterns in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> were mutually exclusively expressed in different organs of the plant. In yeast studies, deletion of specific RP paralogs also gave rise to unique phenotypes (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Ni and Snyder, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Enyenihi and Saunders, 2003</xref>). In human studies, evidence came from patients displaying genetic diseases (i.e., ribosomopathies) caused by haploinsufficiency of genes encoding key factors in ribosome biogenesis or RPs (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Draptchinskaia et al., 1999</xref>). Proteomic-driven analyses exploring composition of purified ribosomes under various conditions identified all RPs differentially expressed between conditions in murine embryonic stem cells, suggesting that different translational statuses were associated with differential stoichiometry among RPs (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Slavov et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we used the STRING (see text footnote 7) algorithm to identify connections/associations between lignin profile correlated proteins. Our results returned interactions between nucleus and plastid proteins (e.g., RPL2.1 and DRH1). While there is currently no direct evidence in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic> that this association exists, there is growing documentation of interactions between homologs of these proteins in other organisms (e.g., humans, yeast, <italic toggle="yes">Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic toggle="yes">Helicobacter pylori</italic>) (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Garcia-Gomez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Havugimana et al., 2012</xref>). Additional studies, however, would need to be performed to verify the actual association, if any, between eukaryotic and plastid translation-associated proteins in <italic toggle="yes">Arabidopsis</italic>.</p><p>These studies indicating the influence of differential ribosomal subunit stoichiometry on differential phenotypes and/or translational products suggest that the ribosome has the ability to function in a regulatory fashion in translation. These supporting data, along with observations of correlative associations between specific ribosomes and lignin production in this study here, support the hypothesis that lignin levels in vascular plants may be partially controlled by specialized ribosome compositions or a lignin &#8220;ribocode.&#8221;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
