Liquid biopsies allow for minimally-invasive multi-omics assessments that can resolve the molecular heterogeneity of internal tissues. Here, we report initial results from the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome Study, a liquid biopsy study with six astronauts who resided on the International Space Station (ISS) for more than 120 days. Analysis of plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) collected before, during, and after spaceflight confirms previously reported mitochondrial dysregulation in space. Screening with 361 cell surface marker antibodies identifies a mitochondrial DNA-enriched fraction associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA-sequencing of the CD36 fraction reveals tissue-enriched RNA species, suggesting the plasma mitochondrial components originated from various tissues. We compare our plasma cfRNA data to mouse plasma cfRNA data from a previous JAXA mission, which had used on-board artificial gravity, and discover a link between microgravity and the observed mitochondrial responses.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="web-summary"><p id="Par2">It has been reported that a spaceflight causes mitochondrial stress in astronauts.

Without effective solutions for aerospace health ailments, increasingly critical challenges will manifest as humanity ventures into crewed interplanetary travel. Solid biopsies have traditionally served as the gold standard for molecular monitoring of human physiology, but such invasive procedures require specialized equipment and carry an increased risk of infection and regional pain. To circumvent these difficulties, researchers on Earth have started to use blood or fluid samples, which are simpler to perform and require little to no recovery time, allowing for increased temporal resolution of sampling. These minimally invasive &#8220;liquid biopsies&#8221; permit the extraction of cell-free nucleic acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which are thought to detect changes earlier than conventional protein biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and to better resolve molecular heterogeneity than standard tissue biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Cell-free nucleic acids have emerged as potential space-relevant biomarkers of psychosocial and physical stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, aging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, metabolic disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and have already been successfully utilized in various terrestrial healthcare contexts, including screening for infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, diagnosing cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and monitoring cancer recurrence and therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. On a similar note, cell-free nucleic acids can infer well-documented spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, in distal tissues without the need for invasive tissue biopsies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, which would be particularly difficult to conduct in orbit.</p><p id="Par4">Longitudinal and full-body molecular profiling using cell-free nucleic acids isolated from liquid biopsies is hence one viable avenue for advancing space healthcare. This approach may grant a detailed understanding of how the human body responds to the space environment and the development of modern countermeasures. Consenting astronauts could participate in lifetime surveillance through annual liquid biopsies, which could reveal the degree of full recovery from spaceflight responses, such as DNA damage and clonal hematopoiesis (CH), the latter of which causes increased lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease and blood cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Liquid biopsies may be particularly constructive during interplanetary spaceflight missions, in which orbital healthcare autonomy will need to be optimized due to the large distance away from Earth. With the advent of the portable, nanopore-based Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION, nucleic acids could potentially be extracted and directly sequenced in-flight by crew to monitor their own health in near real time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The NASA Twins Study provided a unique opportunity to perform a multi-omics analysis with monozygotic twin astronauts, where one participant resided on the ISS for 340 days, and the other remained on Earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The past few years have now welcomed the first studies to examine cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in astronauts, using data from the NASA Twins Study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and data collected 20 years prior with 14 astronauts on short-term missions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Data quality was assessed based on visualization of mapped reads and principal component analysis (PCA) plots (Supplementary Figs.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Two samples (one pre- and one post-flight) were removed from further analysis due to low sequencing library yield and poor mapping quality. PCA plots indicated variations between the six astronauts in the pre-flight phase. As these variations caused difficulties in defining pre-flight baselines, pairwise comparisons of cfRNA profiles using pre-flight baseline samples were not effective (Supplementary Fig.&#160;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref> and Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). However, RNA profiles showed distinct differences between in-flight and post-flight samples. This allowed us to effectively identify altered RNA species between in-flight and post-flight phases, even with the relatively small number of six astronauts participating in our study (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). All time points were consolidated into pre-, in-, and post-flight groups. Statistical analysis was performed to identify 466 differentially represented cfRNAs (DRRs) (ANOVA tool in CLC Genomics Workbench, FDR-adjusted <italic toggle="yes">P</italic>-value&#8201;&lt;&#8201;0.05, |fold change|&#8201;&gt;&#8201;2, |difference|&#8201;&gt;&#8201;50, Supplementary Data&#160;<xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Groups of genes with similar fold-change values were identified through scatterplots, where they formed quasi-straight lines that deviated from the 45-degree diagonal (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Prominent examples included cfRNAs from mitochondrial genes (13 DRRs) and cfRNAs from mucin family genes (8 DRRs), which were increased and decreased respectively during spaceflight (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Subplots e&#8211;j in Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> show normalized quantification values for individual cfRNA species based on mapped genes throughout the time course. cfRNAs from a subset of mitochondria-encoded genes were consistently elevated from in-flight +5 days, reaching a peak at in-flight +30 days, and decreasing at post-flight +3 days. cfRNAs from mucin gene family members decreased during spaceflight and increased transiently during the post-flight phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Molecular pathways affected by spaceflight</title><p id="Par9">cfRNA provides a unique opportunity to estimate molecular changes occurring in the internal tissues of the human body. To explore the functional categories of altered cfRNAs, a pathway analysis was performed using Metascape 3.5<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Consistent with the alteration of mitochondrial RNAs, enrichment of pathways related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Identification of pathways related to the nervous system, including behavior, regulation of synapse organization, modulation of chemical synaptic transmission, and the neuronal system, indicated that blood sampling successfully monitored molecular responses in nervous tissues. Tissue-specificity analysis further supported the alteration of skeletal muscle and the cerebellum (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Mucins are also important for functioning as barriers against external pathogens and for protecting tissues against dehydration and adhesion. Our results could highlight the significance of mucins in the maintenance of tissue integrity, and in the controlling of immunological, physical anti-friction, and anti-adhesion functions, through the maintenance of surface tension under the altered gravity environment.</p><p id="Par28">It is unclear if the two modes of cfRNA responses to spaceflight, an increase in mitochondrial components in plasma cfDNA and cfRNA and a decrease in other cfRNAs derived from internal tissues, are mechanistically related. It is also interesting that the tissue-specificity profiles of both groups of cfRNAs are similar, with brain and skeletal muscle as the most prominent tissue types. One of the potential explanations could be altered properties of blood&#8211;tissue barrier (BTB) functions. Recent studies reported altered integrity of the blood&#8211;brain barrier and blood&#8211;retinal barrier in space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. It is intriguing to note that both studies showed an association between oxidative stress and altered BTB-related molecular processes in space. Murakami et al. have reported seminal studies that directly linked gravity and environmental stressors to BTB regulation and inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS), a process called the gateway reflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>&#8211;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>. Thus, it is possible that the reduced release of cfRNAs from the brain into the plasma could be caused by a reduction in the BTB exchange of cfRNA-containing EVs triggered by microgravity or environmental stresses. As the gateway reflex is linked to pro-inflammatory signals through &#8220;IL-6-amplifier activation&#8221;, potential correlations to neuro-inflammatory responses in the brain and retinal tissues could be the targets for further analysis.</p><p id="Par29">Although the fractionation process in our study was limited by the panel of antibodies used, our results motivate future developments and applications of high-definition liquid biopsies combined with the fractionation of EVs. As more cell-specific surface markers become annotated, the resolution of fractionation will likely improve. Supporting these ideas, we performed another attempt at screening using nuclear-encoded RNAs and identified multiple antibodies that enriched different RNA contents from in-flight and post-flight plasma samples (unpublished results). Either way, improvement in these biomolecular technologies will in turn enable the detection of cell-type-specific gene expression through liquid biopsies, which can be applied for minimally invasive health monitoring and clinical sample analysis on Earth and in space.</p><p id="Par30">As a specific clinical example, the plasma mtDNA-enriched CD36 fraction isolated from in-flight plasma samples contained tissue-specific RNAs indicating eye-related origins (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>), and visual diseases were also represented among the gravity-linked terms (Fig.&#160;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g</xref>). These findings indicate a possibility that liquid biopsies could be useful to detect early molecular events associated with retina tissue damage. Spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS) is one of the puzzling health issues in astronauts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. SANS is present in some astronauts after short and long duration spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and is defined as a constellation of unusual clinical findings, including optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal and retinal folds, hyperopic refractive error shifts, and nerve fiber layer infarcts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>. The cause of SANS remains elusive, but two main hypotheses include elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and compartmentalization of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to the area behind the globe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>. Our study allowed for the resolution of gene expression in tissues that are traditionally difficult to access in humans, such as the retina and choroid plexus, both of which may be relevant to the study of SANS pathophysiology. Mitochondrial responses and ROS have been reported as characteristic features of neuro-inflammation in CNS and retinal diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. These changes have also been observed in mouse spaceflight experiments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup>. These studies, collectively, could suggest mitochondria-related processes, including the ROS and OXPHOS systems, as potential targets for countermeasure development to prevent health problems associated with spaceflight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>. Overall, this example underlines that minimally invasive liquid biopsies could elucidate new perspectives on the cause of and countermeasures for unique space-related ailments.</p><p id="Par31">This study provided a unique opportunity to compare plasma cfRNA between mammalian species in a minimally invasive manner. The space environment consists of many factors, including microgravity, radiation, confinement, noise, altered air pressure and composition, and stress factors associated with launch and return. The use of on-board artificial 1-G controls in the published MHU-1 mission allowed us to identify gene categories specifically affected by the factor of microgravity, and nearly half (49.6%) of the enriched human disease terms were also observed in our human flight data. These gravity-linked terms were not limited to conventional disuse functions, such as bone and muscle loss, but also included metabolic stress responses, neurological disorders, and importantly, ocular and cardiovascular dysfunctions. With the development of sophisticated liquid biopsy technologies combined with multi-omics approaches, the rapid development of human research in space is expected to provide important insights that benefit human health both on and beyond Earth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study registration and ethics</title><p id="Par32">The current human spaceflight study was proposed to and supported by the 2014 International Life Sciences Research Announcements, JAXA, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Since astronauts who belong to space agencies are highly identifiable persons, individual medical and flight-related records were retained by personal information managers and not released to the researchers who performed sample processing and data analysis. RNA-seq raw datasets, which contain genome sequence information, are not publicly available according to the approved conditions of this study. Data access requires ethics committee approvals for the addition of researchers to the study plan. MM is responsible for explaining further details about the ethical circumstances and controlled access for RNA-seq raw data in response to requests within 4 weeks.</p></notes><notes id="FPar2" notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par48">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Goodwin</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Personalized medicine in human space flight: using Omics based analyses to develop individualized countermeasures that enhance astronaut safety and performance</article-title><source>Metabolomics</source><year>2013</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>1134</fpage><lpage>1156</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s11306-013-0556-3</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24273472</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">PMC3825629</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name name-style="western"><surname>Heitzer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Haque</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>CES</given-names></name><name name-style="western"><surname>Speicher</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Current and future perspectives of liquid biopsies in genomics-driven oncology</article-title><source>Nat.
